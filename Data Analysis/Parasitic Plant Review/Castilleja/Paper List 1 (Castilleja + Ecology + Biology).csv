These processes are frequently invoked for Castilleja (Indian paintbrushes) as contributors to morphological and genetic novelty and as complicating factors in species delimitations. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of morphological and genetic evidence for hybridization in a well-characterized hybrid swarm involving three broadly sympatric species (C. miniata, C. rhexiifolia, C. sulphurea) in western Colorado. Field-classified hybrids are present at high frequencies at these sites and show morphological intermediacy to and segregate for chloroplast DNA haplotypes with C. rhexiifolia and C. sulphurea. Contrarily, DNA content and AFLP variation show that field-classified hybrids are not recent hybrids but a distinctive fourth taxon. Actual hybrids (plants showing admixture >= 10% for two genotypic groups) comprised 13% of our sample, with most admixture involving C. rhexiifolia, C. sulphurea, and the unknown taxon. The identity of the field-classified hybrids remains unknown; they either represent a stabilized hybrid species or a species with uncharacteristically high diversity for color alleles. This study highlights the importance of examining concordance and discordance between morphology, cytology, and genetic criteria to understand the complex evolutionary history of diverse groups such as Castilleja.","[Hersch-Green, Erika I.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Cronn, Richard] US Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Northern Arizona University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Hersch-Green, EI (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol, S Beaver St Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",erikahersch@gmail.com,,"Cronn, Richard/0000-0001-5342-3494; Hersch-Green, Erika/0000-0003-3887-0768",,,,NA,99,22,26,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9122,1537-2197,,AM J BOT,Am.

Homoploid hybrid species are generally detected via the presence of genetic additivity of parental markers, novel ecological and spatial distinctions, and novel morphological traits, all of which may aid in the successful establishment of hybrid species from parental types. Speciation and diversification within the genus Castilleja (Orobanchaceae) has been attributed to high levels of hybridization and polyploidy, though currently there are no examples of homoploid hybrid speciation within the genus. We employed multiple lines of evidence to examine a putative hybrid origin in C. christii, a rare endemic, known only from 80 hectares at the summit of Mt. Harrison (Cassia Co., Idaho). Methods: We used granule-bound starch synthase II (waxy) sequences and 26 morphological characters to address hybridization between C. christii and widespread congeners C. miniata and/or C. linariifolia in an area of sympatry. Chromosomes of C. christii were also counted for the first time. Key results: All 230 direct-sequenced C. christii individuals had the additive genomes of both C. miniata and C. linariifolia. Castilleja christii shares traits with both parents but also has floral characters that are unique and transgressive. Cytological counts indicated that all three taxa are diploid. Conclusions: We conclude that C. christii is a stabilized homoploid hybrid derivative of C. linariifolia and C. miniata and is likely following an independent evolutionary trajectory from its progenitors.","[Clay, Danielle L.; Novak, Stephen J.; Serpe, Marcelo D.; Smith, James F.] Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Tank, David C.] Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Tank, David C.] Univ Idaho, Stillinger Herbarium, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",Idaho; Boise State University; Idaho; University of Idaho; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Clay, DL (corresponding author), Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1910 Univ Dr, Boise, ID 83725 USA.",Danielle.L.Clay@gmail.com,,,"Boise State University, Department of Biological Sciences, a National Science Foundation [GK-12]; Northwest Scientific Association Student Research Grant Award; Boise State University Graduate Student Research Grant; Idaho Native Plant Society Education, Research, and Inventory Grant; U.

Subsequent to the elimination of goats from the island in 1992, many populations of C. grisea have reappeared and have been increasing in size. Methods Nineteen populations were surveyed for their genotype at 19 allozyme loci. Key Results At the taxon level, 57.9 % of loci are polymorphic with A(P) = 3.09 and HE = 0.137. Populations averaged 33.0 % polymorphic loci with A(P) = 2.43 and HE = 0.099. Most variation is found within rather than among populations (G(ST) = 0.128), although differentiation among populations is significant. Genetic identities range from I = 0.960 to I = 1.000 with mean I = 0.990. There is no significant relationship between genetic and geographic distance. Gene flow among populations is Nm = 2.50 based on private alleles and Nm = 1.70 based on F-ST. Outcrossing rates based on fixation indices average t = 1.01, indicating a primarily outcrossed mating system. e Conclusions The observed genetic variation is moderately high, unusually so for an insular endemic species, suggesting that C. grisea may not have lost substantial genetic variation during 150 years of overgrazing, and indicating that it is unlikely to be endangered by genetic factors.","Univ S Dakota, Dept Biol, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA",University of South Dakota,"Helenurm, K (corresponding author), Univ S Dakota, Dept Biol, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA.",helenurm@usd.edu,,,,,,NA,40,12,14,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

It grows sympatrically with the subspecies, C. affinis ssp. affinis, which is more widespread but differs in floral color and soil preference. In this study, we used morphometric measurements (three bract, ten floral, and two leaf measurements) and microsatellite markers to determine (1) how the two subspecies differ, (2) if there is evidence of hybridization and (3) quantify the genetic structure of known populations of C. affinis ssp. neglecta. We found that all 15 morphological measurements differed significantly between the subspecies and neutral genetic markers show strong genetic differentiation. Overall we found C. affinis ssp. neglecta populations had similar levels of genetic diversity and genetic differentiation between populations but higher inbreeding than compared to its more common congener. Two populations of C. affinis ssp. neglecta showed lower genetic differentiation from the C. affinis ssp. affinis populations, with some individuals showing considerable overlap in genotypic diversity, hence we cannot rule out historic or low levels hybridization in those populations.

In vitro cultures were initiated using nodal explants from two plants raised from seeds collected from a natural population. Shoots were then multiplied on Murashige and Skoog basal medium with 2.0 mu mol L-1 6-benzylaminopurine (BA), 3.0 mu mol L-1 kinetin (Kn), 2.2 g L-1 phytagel, and 3% sucrose. Explant position on source plants, culture vessel design, and application of different plant growth regulator levels for BA, Kn, and thiadiazuron (TDZ) were tested to optimize micropropagation protocols. Clones from the plants showed differences in plant height and number of nodes in response to various BA and TDZ concentrations. In vitro shoots were successfully rooted under ex vitro conditions using commercial rooting powder (0.8% indole-3-butyric acid) with an average of similar to 17 roots per shoot and acclimatized in the greenhouse with 100% survival rate. Two-month-old plants were transferred to a Parks Canada restoration site at Fort Rodd Hill, Victoria, BC, with 7.5% survival.

Nels., and the annual hemiparasite Orthocarpus purpurascens Benth. grown either without or with a host plant. In addition, the effects of the hemiparasites on the host plants were investigated. All four hemiparasites could grow without a host, indicating that they are facultative parasites; O. purpurascens and C. chromosa produced flowers without a host. However, shoot mass of parasites with a host was 3-41 times that of parasites without a host. For C. miniata, C. chromosa, and O. purpurascens the growth of parasites grown with the legume Medicago sativa L. was compared with that of parasites grown with the grass Lolium perenne L. The legume was consistently a more beneficial host than the grass. In C. miniata and C. chromosa, patterns of biomass allocation were also influenced by the host type. The proportion of biomass allocated to roots was lower in parasites grown with the legume than in plants without a host, whereas it was higher in parasites grown with the grass. The parasites had strong negative effects on host growth, but the extent of host damage depended on the particular parasite-host combination. Castilleja chromosa and O. purpurascens affected the growth of the legume more strongly than that of the grass, whereas C. miniata affected the grass more strongly than the legume. Grasses parasitized by C. miniata allocated more biomass to roots than unparasitized grasses. In the other parasite-host associations the pattern of biomass allocation of the host was not influenced by parasitization. Because the biomass produced by the four hemiparasites was lower than the reduction in host biomass caused by parasitism, the parasites reduced total productivity. Therefore, the studied hemiparasites may potentially affect the structure and diversity of their communities.","UNIV BASEL,INST BOT,CH-4056 BASEL,SWITZERLAND",University of Basel,"Matthies, D (corresponding author), UNIV ZURICH,INST UMWELTWISSENSCHAFTEN,WINTERHURERSTR 190,CH-8057 ZURICH,SWITZERLAND.",,,"Matthies, Diethart/0000-0003-2439-0501",,,,NA,36,47,56,1,31,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4026,,,CAN J BOT,Can.

To determine the effects of hemiparasitism on the population dynamics of the parasite, we identified a set of potential hosts and quantified their effects on the vital rates of C. tenuiflora during 2016-2018. Connections between the roots of the hemiparasite and the hosts were confirmed with a scanning electron microscope. Annual matrices considering two conditions (with and without potential hosts) were built based on vital rates for each year, and annual stochastic finite rate growth rates (lambda(s)) were calculated. Plants produced more reproductive structures with hosts than without hosts. A Life Table Response Experiment (LTRE) was performed to compare the contributions of vital rates between conditions. We identified 19 species of potential hosts for this generalist hemiparasite. Stochastic lambda with hosts lambda(s) = 1.02 (CI = 0.9999, 1.1) tended to be higher than without them lambda(s) = 0.9503 (CI = 0.9055, 0.9981). The highest elasticity values correspond to survival. LTRE indicated that the most important parameters are survival and fecundity; the total contribution of fecundity (0.0192) to the difference in growth was three times lower than that of survival (0.0603). Piqueria trinervia was the most abundant host, and C. tenuiflora had a higher lambda with it than with other species. Individuals can grow alone, but hosts can have a positive effect on the vital parameters of C. tenuiflora and on lambda.","[Granados-Hernandez, Luisa A.; Pisanty, Irene] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Av Univ 3000,Cd Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Raventos, Jose] Univ Alicante, Dept Ecol, Alicante, Spain; [Marquez-Guzman, Judith] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Comparada, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Mandujano, Maria C.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Biodiversidad, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universitat d'Alacant; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Pisanty, I (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Av Univ 3000,Cd Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",ipisanty@unam.mx,,"Mandujano, Maria C./0000-0001-9855-6645; Granados-Hernandez, Luisa A./0000-0002-7204-9327",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Programa de Apoyo a Estudiantes de Posgrado; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia [432340],Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico(Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico); Programa de Apoyo a Estudiantes de Posgrado; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Programa de Apoyo a Estudiantes de Posgrado; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Grant/Award Number: 432340",NA,66,2,2,3,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

Host species could affect parasite interactions with both herbivores and pollinators due to the uptake of defensive compounds and nutrients. However, the effects of different host species on parasitic plants have not been experimentally tested in the field. I determined the effect of two native host species, an alkaloid-producing, nitrogen-fixing lupine and non-alkaloid, non-nitrogen-fixing grass, on herbivory, pollination, and reproduction of the hemiparasitic plant Indian paintbrush (Castilleja indivisa). Within this experiment, I manipulated herbivory and pollination to determine their effects on Indian paintbrush reproduction. Indian paintbrush parasitizing lupines produced three times as many seeds and were more attractive to pollinators than Indian paintbrush parasitizing grass. However, there was no effect of host species on early season or floral herbivory. In addition, MANOVA revealed that host species influenced the response of Indian paintbrush female reproduction to experimentally manipulated herbivory and pollination treatments. Thus, the effect of hosts on parasites is mediated by interactions with herbivores and pollinators, and both direct and indirect effects may shape the selective pressures mediating interactions between hosts and parasites.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Adler, LS (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",lsadler@vt.edu,,,,,,NA,91,34,40,2,69,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2003,84,8,NA,,,,2083,2091,,10.1890/02-0542,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-0542,,,9,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,717EQ,NA,Green Submitted,NA,NA,7/1/24,WOS:000185073100016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Pollination syndromes in Castilleja have been distinguished based on floral traits and historical observations of floral visitors. Here we addressed these questions: (1) Can pollination syndromes be distinguished using floral morphological traits or volatile organic compound emissions? (2) Is there significant variation in floral traits within a pollination syndrome at the level of populations or species? (3) Do pollination syndromes predict the most frequent floral visitor to Castilleja? Methods Floral traits and visitation were measured for five co-occurring Castilleja species (C. applegatei, C. linariifolia, C. miniata, C. nana, and C. peirsonii), representing three pollination syndromes (bee, fly, and hummingbird), at four sites in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and multiple linear regressions to address key questions in the differentiation of Castilleja and floral visitors. Results Our analyses revealed that both morphological traits and floral VOCs can be used to distinguish between some pollination syndromes and Castilleja species. Morphological traits defined pollination syndromes reliably, but within the hummingbird syndrome, there was also significant variation among populations and species. Pollination syndrome was a poor predictor of visitors to Castilleja. Conclusions Floral trait differentiation among Castilleja individuals reflects both taxonomy and pollination syndromes. Differentiation was generally more evident in morphological traits compared to VOCs. Furthermore, a priori notions of pollination syndromes in this system are overly simplistic and fail to predict which animals most frequently visit Castilleja in natural populations.","[Hilpman, Evan T.; Busch, Jeremiah W.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Hilpman, ET (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",evan.hilpman@gmail.com,,"Hilpman, Evan/0000-0003-1668-426X",NSF [DEB 1457037]; Betty Higinbotham Fellowship,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Betty Higinbotham Fellowship,"Research was supported by NSF DEB 1457037 and the Betty Higinbotham Fellowship.

Ipomopsis flowers were hand-pollinated with either purr conspecific pollen (the control) or with C. linariaefolia pollen applied prior to, simultaneously with, or following conspecific pollen. Flowers that were simultaneously given C. linariaefolia and I, aggregata pollen received 39% less conspecific pollen than flowers in the control, but did not set fewer seeds per fruit. Flowers that were given C. linariaefolia pollen first received 30% less conspecific pollen and set 38% fewer seeds per fruit than the control. These results suggest that there is a priority effect; deposition of C. linariaefolia pollen on I. aggregata flowers results in competition, but only when C. linariaefolia pollen is deposited first. Unlike pollen of another competitor of I. aggregata (Delphinium nelsonii Greene. Per.), C, linariaefolia pollen caused competition without inducing an increased rate of stigma closure. Only 12% of I. aggregata's stigmas closed when C. linariaefolia pollen was deposited, and seed set of I. aggregata was reduced relative to the control whether their stigmas closed or not. The low rate at which C. linariaefolia pollen induces closure of I. aggregata's stigmas could be an adaptation to reduce the negative effects of competition.","Univ Illinois, Shelford Vivarium, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Grinnell Coll, Dept Biol, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA.",carusoc@grinnell.edu,,"Caruso, Christina/0000-0001-7069-9572",,,,NA,44,59,68,0,20,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4026,,,CAN J BOT,Can.

In addition to the North American annuals, a second radiation of annual Castilleja species is in Andean Peru and central Chile. Phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast and nuclear DNA regions revealed a complex history for the origin and diversification of annual Castilleja species in South America. In addition to at least three independent long-distance dispersal events from North America, allopolyploidy has played a significant role in this disjunct radiation. Only C. ottenuata occurs in both California and South America, and these results support its recent arrival to central Chile. Two Peruvian species are inferred to be allopolyploids; hybridization between annual lineages derived from independent long-distance dispersal events from North America gave rise to C. profunda, and hybridization between South American annual and perennial species gave rise to C. cerroana.

Therefore, it is surprising that little is known about whether ploidy variation, both within and among species, influences spatial patterns of interspecific hybridization. The role that polyploidy plays in structuring gene flow patterns between three co-occurring Indian paintbrush (Castilleja) species is investigated. Methods: Reciprocal hand pollinations were performed in populations where the three species co-occur with and without variable plants (previous data tested the ancestral hybrid history of these variable plants). I measured fruit set, seed production, seed germination, and the DNA content of parent plants and 26 synthesized F-1 hybrids. Data were combined with pollinator fidelity data to estimate the contribution of individual barriers to reproductive isolation. Key results: Interspecific gene flow could occur in all directions, but barriers were weaker for conspecific vs. heterospecific crosses. Species were nearly fixed for different ploidy levels, but some deviations occurred, primarily in populations with variable plants. Interspecific gene flow could occur across ploidy levels, but it was more likely when species had the same number of chromosomes or when resulting F-1 hybrids had even numbers of chromosomes. Postzygotic reproductive barriers were generally weaker than pollinator fidelity. Conclusions: Polyploidy likely plays a large role in shaping contemporary and historical patterns of gene flow among these species. This study suggests that differences in chromosome numbers among closely related, compatible species might help structure spatial patterns of hybridization.","Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",Michigan Technological University,"Hersch-Green, EI (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",eherschg@mtu.edu,,"Hersch-Green, Erika/0000-0003-3887-0768",National Institutes of Health IGERT training fellowship; National Science Foundation graduate predoctoral fellowship; National Science Foundation dissertation improvement grant [DEB-0412350],National Institutes of Health IGERT training fellowship; National Science Foundation graduate predoctoral fellowship; National Science Foundation dissertation improvement grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I thank L.

To determine if alkaloids are present in all tissues of plants parasitizing lupins, we analyzed floral tissue as well as leaves of both Castilleja species. Leaves, bracts, calices, corollas, gynoecium and nectar of both Castilleja species were examined for quinolizidine alkaloid presence using a Dragendorff reagent, and alkaloids were identified in vegetative tissue and nectar by capillary GLC and GLC-MS. Lupanine and alpha-isolupanine were the principal alkaloids in C. indivisa parasitizing L. texensis, while principal alkaloids of C. miniata parasitizing L. argenteus were 5,6-iso-dehydrolupanine, alpha-isolupanine, thermopsine, and 17-oxolupanine. Except for 17-oxolupanine, which was probably synthesized by biotransformation in the parasite, all other alkaloids correspond to those present in the host plants. Alkaloids were present in the leaves of both Castilleja species, and in the bracts, calices and gynoecium of some plants, but never in the corollas. Alkaloids from L. texensis and L. argenteus were not detected in nectar of either Castelleja species. The presence of alkaloids leaves and outer floral tissue of both Castilleja species, but not nectar. may explain why alkaloid uptake and storage affected herbivores but not pollinators.

Hemiparasites are capable of connecting to their hosts' root or stem vascular systems through haustoria establishing a flow of water and nutrients between host and parasite. These parasitic associations have an important influence on biodiversity, consequently shaping plant communities through a reduction in growth and alteration of the competitive ability of parasitized hosts. Castilleja fissifolia L.f. (Orobanchaceae), the genus' type species, is an abundant erect herb that inhabits the high tropical Andes and is commonly found in close spatial association with other plant species. Since many other species of the genus Castilleja have been described as hemiparasites, we sought to determine if C. fissifolia establishes parasitic relationships in the Venezuelan high Andes. And if so, to study its host range and facultative/obligate relations. Ten soil blocks which included C. fissifolia individuals were excavated from each of three sites in Piedras Blancas Paramo (PBP, 4250 m), taken to the laboratory and thoroughly examined to identify the presence of C. fissifolia-host interfaces. Instances in which one or more haustoria were found anchored to the roots of a potential host were recorded. C fissifolia acts as a non-specific hemiparasite of at least 44 plant species in PBP, including 25 eudicots, 18 monocots, and 1 pteridophyte, belonging to 16 plant families. These results represent the largest reported host range for any species within the genus Castilleja.","[Carrasco, Ricardo; Rada, Fermin; Ramirez, Lirey] Univ Andes, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Ecol ICAE, Merida, Venezuela; [Rada, Fermin] Univ Andes, Lab Ecol & Fisiol Vegetal Lab EcoFiV, Bogota, Colombia; [Ramirez, Lirey] Univ Marburg, Fac Geog, Ecol Plant Geog, Deutschhausstr 10, D-35032 Marburg, Germany",University of Los Andes Venezuela; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Philipps University Marburg,"Rada, F (corresponding author), Univ Andes, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Ecol ICAE, Merida, Venezuela.",f.rada@uniandes.edu.co,,"Ramirez, Lirey/0000-0003-1560-7078; Rada, Fermin/0000-0003-4486-2414; Carrasco, Ricardo/0009-0004-0176-5993","Open Society University Network (OSUN); Universidad de Los Andes (UniAndes, Bogota-Colombia)","Open Society University Network (OSUN); Universidad de Los Andes (UniAndes, Bogota-Colombia)","We thank J.

We conducted common garden experiments with golden paintbrush (Castilleja levisecta), an endangered species from the Pacific Northwest, U.S.A., in order to test hypotheses about reintroduction performance and to provide management recommendations. Ten common gardens, each composed of C. levisecta individuals grown from seed from six of the remaining populations, were planted into field conditions and monitored during two growing seasons. Plant community characteristics were important predictors of observed variation in C. levisecta performance. Exotic species-cover at common garden sites was associated with a reduction in performance of first-year C. levisecta transplants, while survival to the second growing season increased with increasing similarity in plant functional groups between source and common garden sites. Although measures of genetic diversity, population size, and geographic distance are often used to make conservation decisions during species recovery, here they were poor predictors of C. levisecta performance and establishment.

Currently restricted to two island populations off British Columbia and nine populations (eight on islands) in Washington, C. levisecta is a rare species threatened with extinction. Allozymes were used to describe genetic diversity and structure in these eleven populations. Despite its threatened status and small geographic range, exceptionally high levels of genetic diversity are maintained within C. levisecta. All sixteen of the loci resolved were polymorphic within the species (P-s=100%), while the mean percentage of loci polymorphic within populations (P-p) was 65.7%. The mean number of alleles per polymorphic locus (AP(s)) was 2.94 within the species and averaged 2.38 within populations (AP(p)). Genetic diversity (H-es) was 0.285 for the species, whereas mean population genetic diversity (H-ep) was 0.213. Smaller populations had, on average, fewer observed alleles and less genetic diversity. A significant negative correlation (r = 0.72) was found between genetic identity and geographic distance, indicating reduced gene flow between distant populations. The most geographically isolated population was one of the larger populations, one of the most genetically diverse and the most genetically divergent. A wide range of pairwise population genetic identities (I = 0.771 - 0.992) was found, indicating considerable genetic divergence between some populations. Overall, 19% of the total genetic diversity was distributed among populations. Results of this survey indicate that genetic augmentation of existing populations is unnecessary. The high allelic diversity found for the species and within its populations holds promise for conservation and restoration efforts to save this rare and threatened plant species.","Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Washington State Dept Nat Resources, Washington Nat Heritage Program, Olympia, WA 98504 USA; Univ Georgia, Dept Genet, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",godt@plantbio.uga.edu,,,,,,NA,60,43,51,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1566-0621,1572-9737,,CONSERV GENET,Conserv.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis of two chloroplast (rps16 and trnL/F) and two nuclear ribosomal (internal and external transcribed spacers) DNA regions support the monophyly of subtribe Castillejinae (Orobanchaceae). A well-supported phylogeny of the six genera (Castilleja [similar to 180 spp.], Clevelandia [1 sp.], Cordylanthus [18 spp.], Ophiocephalus [1 sp.], Orthocarpus [9 spp.], and Triphysaria [5 spp]) comprising the subtribe is presented, and morphological synapomorphies are identified for the major lineages recovered. Orthocarpus and Triphysaria are both monophyletic; Cordylanthus is biphyletic. Clevelandia and Ophiocephalus are derived from within Castilleja. The perennial Castilleja clade (similar to 160 spp.) is derived from a grade of annual taxa including Castilleja sect. Oncorhynchus (16 spp.), Cordylanthus, Orthocarpus, and Triphysaria. This suggests that the perennial habit evolved a single time from an annual ancestral lineage that persisted throughout the diversification of Castillejinae, contrary to classical interpretations of life history evolution in plants. Given the prevalence of polyploidy among perennial Castilleja species, perenniality may have played an important role in the origin and establishment of polyploidy in Castilleja.","[Tank, David C.; Olmstead, Richard G.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Olmstead, Richard G.] Univ Washington, Burke Museum Nat Hist, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Tank, DC (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Div Bot, Peabody Museum Nat Hist, POB 208118, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",david.tank@yale.edu,,,,,,NA,104,94,107,1,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9122,1537-2197,,AM J BOT,Am.

Explanations offered to explain patterns of hybridization that vary by population have usually focused on genetic or environmental factors. Instead, we examined whether different community contexts might change pollinator preference and constancy and thus influence the likelihood of hybridization among three Indian paintbrush species (Castilleja miniata, C. rhexifolia, and C. sulphurea). To determine whether visitation was context-dependent, we observed pollinator behavior in experimental arrays (constructed using flowering stems of the three Indian paintbrush species) in different contexts. Contexts were defined by which Castilleja species occurred in the immediate neighborhood of the arrays. Specifically, we asked, does visitation to particular species in the arrays depend on context? In general, each Castilleja species was preferred when it matched the surrounding community context, as is predicted by optimal foraging theory. More interestingly, pollinator constancy was weakened in the hybrid context (an area where the three species co-occurred with morphologically intermediate plants), which is likely to increase pollen flow among the species. Reduced pollinator constancy in hybrid zones could set up a positive feedback loop in which more flower diversity is created through hybridization, decreasing pollinator constancy, and leading to more hybridization. This self-reinforcing mechanism could lead to hybridization hot spots and to a patchy distribution of hybrid populations. We expect that this mechanism may be important in other animal-pollinated plant hybrid zones.","Univ Oregon, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Eugene, OR 97405 USA",University of Oregon,"Hersch, EI (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Eugene, OR 97405 USA.",ehersch@uoregon.edu,"Roy, Barbara (â€˜Bitty/HZJ-1032-2023","Hersch-Green, Erika/0000-0003-3887-0768",,,,NA,93,58,69,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,JAN,2007,61,1,NA,,,,111,124,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00009.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00009.x,,,14,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,137HZ,17300431,Bronze,NA,NA,7/1/24,WOS:000244285000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

We evaluated the plant density, size, phenological stage, number of haustoria, and potential hosts in a field population of C. tenuiflora. Cross-and longitudinal sections of haustoria were stained with safranin O and fast green, and the presence of starch and tannins was determined histochemically. The density of C. tenuiflora in the field population was 8 +/- 13 plants/m(2) and there were plants at the vegetative, floral, and senescent stages. The number (1-6) and size (0.5-2.5 mm) of haustoria varied with plant size. In the field, individuals of C. tenuiflora were growing near plants belonging to families Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Pinaceae and Poaceae. The haustoria were globular, bore hairs, and consisted of dermal, ground, vascular, and young endophyte. Starch was stored in the ground tissue and condensed tannins were present in the young endophyte. The haustoria also contained sclerotic tissue (fibers and sclereids), alternate-pit-type vessel elements, and scalariform tracheids.

Less is known about how these processes interact at early stages of speciation. Here, we compared population-level differentiation in floral phenotype and genetic sequence variation among recently diverged Castilleja to explore patterns of diversification under different scenarios of reproductive isolation. Methods Using target enrichment enabled by the Angiosperms353 probe set, we assessed genetic distance among 50 populations of four Castilleja species. We investigated whether patterns of genetic divergence are explained by floral trait variation or geographic distance in two focal groups: the widespread C. sessiliflora and the more restricted C. purpurea species complex. Results We document that C. sessiliflora and the C. purpurea complex are characterized by high diversity in floral color across varying geographic scales. Despite phenotypic divergence, groups were not well supported in phylogenetic analyses, and little genetic differentiation was found across targeted Angiosperms353 loci. Nonetheless, a principal coordinate analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed differentiation within C. sessiliflora across floral morphs and geography and less differentiation among species of the C. purpurea complex. Conclusions Patterns of genetic distance in C. sessiliflora suggest species cohesion maintained over long distances despite variation in floral traits. In the C. purpurea complex, divergence in floral color across narrow geographic clines may be driven by recent selection on floral color. These contrasting patterns of floral and genetic differentiation reveal that divergence can arise via multiple eco-evolutionary paths.","[Wenzell, Katherine E.; Wickett, Norman J.; Fant, Jeremie B.; Skogen, Krissa A.] Northwestern Univ, Program Plant Biol & Conservat, OT Hogan Hall,Room 6-140B,2205 Tech Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Wenzell, Katherine E.; McDonnell, Angela J.; Wickett, Norman J.; Fant, Jeremie B.; Skogen, Krissa A.] Chicago Bot Garden, Negaunee Inst Plant Conservat Sci & Act, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA; [Wenzell, Katherine E.] John Innes Ctr, Norwich Res Pk,Colney Lane, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England",Northwestern University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); John Innes Center,"Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Program Plant Biol & Conservat, OT Hogan Hall,Room 6-140B,2205 Tech Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), Chicago Bot Garden, Negaunee Inst Plant Conservat Sci & Act, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA.;Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), John Innes Ctr, Norwich Res Pk,Colney Lane, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England.",kwenzell@u.northwestern.edu,"Skogen, Krissa/AAA-3370-2022; Wickett, Norman/AAV-8136-2021; McDonnell, Angela/T-3971-2019","Skogen, Krissa/0000-0002-7868-9632; Wickett, Norman/0000-0003-0944-1956; McDonnell, Angela/0000-0002-2549-9253; Wenzell, Katherine/0000-0002-1635-5485; Fant, Jeremie/0000-0001-9276-1111","Botanical Society of America; American Society of Plant Taxonomists; American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant; Friends of Nachusa Grasslands; Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; NSF [DGE-1842165, DBI-461007, DBI-1757800, DEB-1752785]; Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation and Action at the Chicago Botanic Garden",Botanical Society of America; American Society of Plant Taxonomists; American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant; Friends of Nachusa Grasslands; Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation and Action at the Chicago Botanic Garden,"The authors thank the members of the Skogen--Fant lab group and two anonymous reviewers for feedback on previous versions of this manuscript.

The haustorium is the characteristic structure of hemiparasitic plants and its anatomy varies depending several factors such as host species, position on the root and environment. Question: What is the structure and anatomy of haustoria builded in field interaction? Based on C, N and chlorophyll contents, is C. tenuiflora a facultative hemiparasite of B. conferta? Species studied: Castilleja tenuiflora Benth. and Baccharis conferta Kunth. Study site and dates: Plant materials were collected in the Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl National Park (N 19 degrees 0.5' 9.6 '', W 98 degrees 40' 24.2 '', 3,480 m.a.s.l.), State of Mexico, Mexico, in December 2013. Methods: Individuals of B. conferta and C. tenuiflora growing independently or in hemiparasite interactions were collected and samples were processed for anatomical and histochemical characterization, determination of C, N and chlorophyll. Results: Haustoria were globular and located mainly in the lateral roots of B. conferta. Anatomy of haustorium shows the characteristic structures: exophyte and endophyte. Haustorial tissues storage starch, tannins and essential oils while in the B. conferta roots also calcium oxalate crystals were found. C levels were significantly influenced by hemiparasitic interaction. This is the first study that characterizes a hemiparasitic interaction in the field and specifically between C. tenuiflora and B. conferta. Conclusions: Haustoria builded in interaction with B. conferta show the characteristic structure and anatomy. Hemiparasitic relationship represents for C. tenuiflora a source of C and other compounds such as essential oils.","[Montes-Hernandez, Edith; Bermudez-Torres, Kalina; Luis Trejo-Espino, Jose; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot, Dept Biotecnol, Yautepec, Morelos, Mexico; [Sandoval-Zapotitla, Estela] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Jardin Bot, Lab Anat Vegetal, Coyoacan, Ciudad De Mexic, Mexico; [Montes-Hernandez, Edith] Tecnol Estudios Super Ixtapaluca, Dept Ingn Ambiental, Ixtapaluca, Estado De Mexic, Mexico",Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Trejo-Tapia, G (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot, Dept Biotecnol, Yautepec, Morelos, Mexico.",gttapia@ipn.mx,"Trejo-Espino, JoseLuis/AAK-4854-2021; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela/M-3725-2013","Bermudez Torres, Kalina/0000-0002-7267-7657",Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del Instituto Politecnico Nacional [1623-20150389]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT-Mexico) [CB-2013-01-220007]; CONACyT,Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del Instituto Politecnico Nacional; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT-Mexico)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"This research was financed by the Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del Instituto Politecnico Nacional (grants 1623-20150389) and by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT-Mexico) (Grant CB-2013-01-220007).

Thus, availability of N-fixing hosts may affect parasite's WUE and in turn impact the surrounding plant community. Here, I investigate how the availability of an N-fixing host affects the root hemiparasite, Castilleja applegatei, and examines host-mediated effects on community structure and soil moisture. I surveyed plant diversity and percent cover and measured soil moisture in 120 1 x 1 m plots within Sagehen Experimental Forest, CA. Fifty percent of the plots included C. applegatei. In a subset of plots, I measured leaf N, C/N, delta C-13, and delta N-15 in C. applegatei and in one N-fixer (Ceanothus prostratus) and two non-N-fixing plants (Artemisia tridentata and Wyethia mollis). In C. applegatei availability of N-fixing hosts corresponded to a significant increase in leaf %N, a distinct delta N-15 signature, and an increase in delta C-13 (which typically signifies an increased WUE). The presence of parasites was associated with a marginally significant decrease in WUE in N-fixing neighbors, but had no effect on the two non-N-fixing species. The presence of parasites did not impact diversity, percent cover, or soil moisture. These results broadly support the N-parasitism hypothesis and indicate that host type can affect parasite's physiology and therefore have the potential to mediate parasite's effects in the community; however, community-level impacts were not found here.","[Haynes, Audrey F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Haynes, AF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",audreyhaynes@berkeley.edu,,"Haynes, Audrey/0000-0002-1764-2101","Department of Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley","Department of Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley","This research was funded through the Summer Research Award from the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley.",NA,75,2,2,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,FEB,2022,223,2,NA,,,,213,228,,10.1007/s11258-021-01200-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-021-01200-x,,Nov-21,16,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,YK7PX,NA,hybrid,NA,NA,7/1/24,WOS:000716257400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Photosynthetic rates differed greatly between years; rates in 1995 were more than double those in 1994, likely due to more precipitation and less water stress during 1995. Despite this difference in precipitation, photosynthetic rates for C, linariifolia were not different from those of their hosts for either year. However, carbon isotope ratios of C. linariifolia and O. tolmiei were up to 3 parts per thousand more negative than those of their A. tridentata hosts. Using measured delta(13)C ratios in conjunction with delta(13)C ratios predicted from gas-exchange measurements, we calculated that C. linariifolia derived, on average, 40% of its leaf carbon heterotrophically. Contrary to current suggestions that high photosynthetic rates of hemiparasites are an indication of reduced heterotrophy, C. linariifolia exhibited photosynthetic rates similar to autotrophic plants and used a substantial amount of host-derived carbon.

This study investigated larval preference, performance, and sequestration of iridoid glycosides in a population of E. anicia at Crescent Meadows, Colorado, USA. Although previous studies showed that other populations in Colorado use the host plant, Castilleja integra (Orobanchaceae), we found no evidence for E. anicia ovipositing or feeding on C. integra at Crescent Meadows. Though C. integra and another host plant, Penstemon glaber (Plantaginaceae), occur at Crescent Meadows, the primary host plant used was P. glaber. To determine why C. integra was not being used at the Crescent Meadows site, we first examined the host plant preference of naive larvae between P. glaber and C. integra. Then we assessed the growth and survivorship of larvae reared on each plant species. Finally, we quantified the iridoid glycoside concentrations of the two plant species and diapausing caterpillars reared on each host plant. Our results showed that E. anicia larvae prefer P. glaber. Also, larvae survive and grow better when reared on P. glaber than on C. integra. Castilleja integra was found to contain two primary iridoid glycosides, macfadienoside and catalpol, and larvae reared on this plant sequestered both compounds; whereas P. glaber contained only catalpol and larvae reared on this species sequestered catalpol. Thus, although larvae are able to use C. integra in the laboratory, the drivers behind the lack of use at the Crescent Meadows site remain unclear.","[Bradley, Lauren E.; Kelly, Caitlin A.; Bowers, M.

In this greenhouse study, I focused on pairs of hosts consisting of either two leguminous host individuals (Lupinus arboreus; Fabaceae), two non-nitrogen-fixing hosts (Eriophyllum stachaedifolium; Asteraceae), or one individual of each of these species. Castilleja growth and reproductive performance were greatly improved by the simultaneous attack of two distinct host species, even though Castilleja grown with two Lupinus hosts had significantly higher nitrogen content. Different combinations of host species also strongly affected the growth of aphid colonies feeding on the Castilleja used in this experiment. Across all treatments, the growth of aphid colonies was positively correlated with the nitrogen content of the parasitic plants, which, in turn depended on the combination of hosts attacked. Aphid colonies feeding on parasites attacking a mixture of host species grew more slowly than those on parasites attacking two Lupinus individuals. Therefore, simultaneous attack of a mixture of host species may lead to improved parasite performance in two ways-via a direct benefit on parasite growth and flowering as well as a possible indirect benefit because of the relatively poor performance of herbivores feeding on these parasites.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Univ Washington, Dept Zool, Box 351800, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,"Marvier, Michelle/0000-0001-8360-9265",,,,NA,56,47,56,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1998,79,4,NA,,,,1272,1280,,,,,,9,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZQ282,NA,,NA,NA,7/1/24,WOS:000073841800012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we share how our growing understanding of the complex ecology of these species has given rise to large-scale management questions and conflicts, and outline the strategies we are using to navigate these challenges. Our approach has included convening periodic workshops with experts on both species; designing and implementing research studies to fill knowledge gaps about the two species' relationship; and identifying no regrets actions that can be taken to benefit one or both species with minimal risk in the face of uncertainty. While the details of this case study are highly specific, the lessons can be applied to other systems with interacting listed species.","[Dunwiddie, Peter W.; Fimbel, Cheryl] Ctr Nat Lands Management, Union Ave, Olympia, WA 98501 USA; [Dunwiddie, Peter W.; Haan, Nathan L.; Bakker, Jonathan D.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & ForestSci, Box 354115, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Linders, Mary] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, 600 Capitol Way N, Olympia, WA 98501 USA; [Thomas, Theodore B.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Washington Field Off, Lacey, WA 98503 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife (WDFW); United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service,"Dunwiddie, PW (corresponding author), Ctr Nat Lands Management, Union Ave, Olympia, WA 98501 USA.;Dunwiddie, PW (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & ForestSci, Box 354115, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",pdunwidd@uw.edu,"Bakker, Jonathan/I-6960-2013; Dunwiddie, Peter/Q-7709-2016","Bakker, Jonathan/0000-0002-8973-2771; Dunwiddie, Peter/0000-0002-7254-0423; Haan, Nathan/0000-0003-1713-7911",US Fish and Wildlife Service; US Department of Defense through the Army Compatible Use Buffer program; Joint Base Lewis-McChord Fish and Wildlife program; Oregon Zoo; Washington State Department of Corrections,US Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service); US Department of Defense through the Army Compatible Use Buffer program; Joint Base Lewis-McChord Fish and Wildlife program; Oregon Zoo; Washington State Department of Corrections,"Many researchers, land managers, organizations, and agencies have contributed to the recovery efforts for golden paintbrush and Taylor's checkerspot, and to the formative discussions described herein.

Longer floral tubes, a trait associated with long-tongued pollinators, can also exclude other pollinators from accessing rewards, a potential mechanism for specialization. Across most of its range, Castilleja sessiliflora displays much longer corollas than most Castilleja species, though tube length varies geographically and correlates partially with hawkmoth visitation. To assess whether long corolla tubes reflect adaptation to hawkmoth pollinators, we performed a day/night pollinator exclusion experiment in nine natural populations that varied in corolla length across the range of C. sessiliflora and short-tubed members of the parapatric C. purpurea complex. We compared the fitness contributions of nocturnal and diurnal visitors, revealing that long-tubed populations visited predominantly by hawkmoths experienced greater fruit set at night, in contrast with short-tubed populations or those visited mainly by diurnal pollinators. Next, leveraging a range-wide multiyear dataset of pollinator visitation to these species, we identify that hawkmoth visitation is associated with increased fitness in long-tubed populations overall, and that long tubes are associated with less diverse visitor assemblages. Thus, long corollas represent an adaptation to hawkmoth pollination at the exclusion of diverse pollinators. Nonetheless, while hawkmoths were scarce in the northern range, secondary diurnal pollinators contributed to fruit set across the range, providing reproductive assurance despite possible trait mismatch. This study illustrates adaptive generalization in pollination systems and that floral divergence may proceed along a continuum of generalized and specialized pollinator interactions.","[Wenzell, Katherine E.] Calif Acad Sci, Bot Dept, 55 Mus Concourse Dr, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Wenzell, Katherine E.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD USA; [Zhang, Johnathan Y.] Boston Univ, Interdisciplinary Programs Bioinformat, Boston, MA USA; [Skogen, Krissa A.] Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clemson, SC USA; [Fant, Jeremie B.] Northwestern Univ, Program Plant Biol & Conservat, Evanston, IL USA; [Fant, Jeremie B.] Chicago Bot Garden, Negaunee Inst Plant Conservat Sci & Act, Glencoe, IL USA",California Academy of Sciences; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Boston University; Clemson University; Northwestern University,"Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), Calif Acad Sci, Bot Dept, 55 Mus Concourse Dr, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA.",kewenzell@gmail.com,,"Wenzell, Katherine/0000-0002-1635-5485","Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; Nature Conservancy Chapters of TX and IL, Native Prairies Association of Texas, City of Lubbock, TX, TX Parks and Wildlife Department, NM Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, IL Nature Preserves Commission, IL Department of Natural Resources; US Forest Service; American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant; Friends of Nachusa Grasslands, Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation [DGE-1842165]; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship award; Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation and Action at the Chicago Botanic Garden","Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; Nature Conservancy Chapters of TX and IL, Native Prairies Association of Texas, City of Lubbock, TX, TX Parks and Wildlife Department, NM Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, IL Nature Preserves Commission, IL Department of Natural Resources; US Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant; Friends of Nachusa Grasslands, Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation and Action at the Chicago Botanic Garden","The authors thank A.

Hemiparasites are postulated to be keystone species in grassland communities if they suppress dominant species and increase plant community biodiversity, and ecosystem engineers if they increase nutrient accessibility for surrounding species. We examined keystone effects by evaluating species richness and evenness in 1 m2 plots in a recent prairie restoration where Castilleja sessiliflora was naturally present or absent, and in a longer-established prairie restoration with or without Pedicularis canadensis. We examined ecosystem engineer effects by determining nitrate and phosphate concentrations under, 25 cm from, and 50 cm from hemiparasites, and in the center of hemiparasite-free plots. On the C. sessiliflora site, plots with the hemiparasites had higher species richness due to more forbs and higher floristic quality, consistent with the keystone species hypothesis. Soil phosphate levels were also greater in plots with C. sessiliflora present, consistent with the hypothesis of ecosystem engineering by this hemiparasite. In contrast, plots with/without P. canadensis showed no associations of any community metrics with the hemiparasite, and no correspondence between the presence of hemiparasites and soil nutrients. Although hemiparasites can increase grassland community heterogeneity, the effect is not universal, and the direction and strength of effects likely depends on local conditions.","[Scheidel, Anna; Borowicz, Victoria] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Scheidel, Anna] Champaign Cty Forest Preserve Dist, 109 Lake Woods Rd, Mahomet, IL 61853 USA",Illinois State University,"Borowicz, V (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",vaborow@ilstu.edu,,,Friends of Nachusa Grasslands,Friends of Nachusa Grasslands,"We thank M.

Variation in the impacts of hemiparasites on diversity and production could be due to the difference in the relative strength of two interacting pathways: direct negative effects of parasitism and positive effects on N availability via litter. Strong effects of parasitism should result in substantial changes in diversity and declines in productivity. Conversely, strong litter effects should result in minor changes in diversity and increased productivity. We conducted field-based surveys to determine the association of Castilleja occidentalis with diversity and productivity in the alpine tundra. To examine litter effects, we compared the decomposition of Castilleja litter with litter of four other abundant plant species, and examined the decomposition of those four species when mixed with Castilleja. Castilleja was associated with minor changes in diversity but almost a twofold increase in productivity and greater foliar N in co-occurring species. Our decomposition trials suggest litter effects are due to both the rapid N loss of Castilleja litter and the effects of mixing Castilleja litter with co-occurring species. Castilleja produces litter that accelerates decomposition in the alpine tundra, which could accelerate the slow N cycle and boost productivity. We speculate that these positive effects of litter outweigh the effects of parasitism in nutrient-poor systems with long-lived hemiparasites. Determining the relative importance of parasitism and litter effects of this functional group is crucial to understand the strong but variable roles hemiparasites play in affecting community structure and ecosystem processes.","[Spasojevic, Marko J.; Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Spasojevic, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mspasoje@uci.edu,"SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/AAO-4307-2020; Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017","SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/0000-0003-1808-0048; Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176",Andrew W.

By reducing the abundance of dominant plants and releasing subordinates from competitive exclusion, they can have an outsized impact on plant communities. Most research on the ecological role of hemiparasites is manipulative and focuses on a small number of hemiparasitic taxa. Here, we ask whether patterns in natural plant communities match the expectation that hemiparasites affect the structure of plant communities. Our data were collected on 129 national park units spanning the continental United States. The most common hemiparasite genera were Pedicularis, Castilleja, Krameria, and Comandra. We used null models and linear mixed models to determine whether hemiparasites were associated with changes in community richness and evenness. Hemiparasite presence did not affect community metrics. Hemiparasite abundance was positively associated with increasing evenness of herbaceous species, but not with species richness. The associations that we observed on a continental scale are consistent with evidence that the impacts of root hemiparasitic plants on evenness can be substantial and abundance dependent but that effects on richness are less pronounced. Hemiparasites mediate competitive exclusion in communities to facilitate species coexistence and merit consideration of inclusion in ecological theories of coexistence.","[Hodzic, Jasna; Bakker, Jonathan D.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Pearse, Ian] US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Beaury, Evelyn M.] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Organism & Evolutionary Biol Grad Program, Amherst, MA USA; [Corbin, Jeffrey D.] Union Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Union College,"Hodzic, J (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jhodzic@uw.edu,,"Corbin, Jeffrey/0000-0002-3377-5916; Beaury, Evelyn/0000-0002-7971-3593; Hodzic, Jasna/0000-0001-5011-8830; Bakker, Jonathan/0000-0002-8973-2771",Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP); National Science Foundation [DGE-1762114],Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP); National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DGE-1762114",NA,63,2,2,6,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2022,103,12,NA,,,,,,,10.1002/ecy.3837,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3837,,Sep-22,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6S4CV,36178041,"hybrid, Green Published",NA,NA,7/1/24,WOS:000861821200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The autotroph Scrophularia nodosa (Scrophulariaceae) has been chosen as a control. It is shown that the main preconditions providing the possibility of rapid haustorium development are the long life of the primary outermost tissue of the root - the rhizodermis that covers the entire length of both young and older roots, and constant readiness of this tissue to form special haustorial hairs, and also an unusual structure of exodermis, which in many details is similar to rhizodermis. The formation of haustorial hairs is one of the earliest structural events in haustorium development; the haustorial hairs are long, with a smooth surface. The division and elongation of cells in the outer tissues play a major role in the early stages of endophyte development. The parasitic form of life influence the inner structure of the vascular cylinder that appears as the reduction of phloem conductive elements and the accumulation of large amounts of starch in the xylem. It was found that the haustoria can penetrate not only in the roots but also in the rhizomes of the host plants.","[Pavlenko, E. V.; Petrova, S.

For example, parasitic plants obtain defensive compounds as well as nutrients from their hosts, and thus many attributes of parasitic plants are dependent on the quality of their host species. Here I measure the effect of a lupine host species (Lupinus argenteus) compared to other host species on herbivory, pollination, and female plant fitness in the hemiparasite Indian paintbrush (Castilleja miniata) using a series of field experiments. Association with lupine was determined in the field by assaying Indian paintbrush leaves for lupine alkaloids. I found that Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines experienced reduced herbivory from plume moth larvae, agromyzid fly larvae, and deer, relative to Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing other host species. However, there was no correlation between alkaloid content of inflorescences and plume moth performance. Host species did not affect pollinator preference for Indian paintbrush in the field. Indian paintbrush parasitizing lupines produced twice as many seeds overall as Indian paintbrush parasitizing other host species. Correlations suggest that this benefit arises both from reduced herbivory and increased nitrogenous resources. The reduction of herbivory in Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines indicates that host species can affect performance of hemiparasites via indirect pathways, and that the larger community of herbivores could alter the impact of a host on its plant parasites.","Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Adler, LS (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Biol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,,,,,,NA,67,30,36,0,54,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2002,83,10,NA,,,,2700,2710,,10.2307/3072008,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3072008,,,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,617ER,NA,Green Submitted,NA,NA,7/1/24,WOS:000179348800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Invasive removal programs on islands are conservation efforts that can also be viewed as powerful manipulative experiments, but few data are available to evaluate their effects. We collected demographic and herbivore damage data for Castilleja mollis Pennell, an endangered plant endemic to Santa Rosa Island, California, over a 12-year period before, during, and after the implementation of control for introduced cattle, deer, and elk. We used these long-term data to explore mechanisms underlying herbivore effects, assess the results of herbivore reduction at the scales of both individual plants and populations, and determine how temporal variability in herbivory and plant demography influenced responses to herbivore removals. For individual plants, herbivore effects mediated by disturbance were greater than those of grazing. Deer and elk scraping of the ground substantially increased plant mortality and dormancy and reduced flowering and growth. Stem damage from browsing did not affect survivorship but significantly reduced plant growth and flower production. Herbivore control successfully lowered damage rates, which declined steeply between 1997 and 2000 and have remained relatively low. Castilleja mollis abundances rose sharply after 1997, suggesting a positive effect of herbivore control, but then began to decline steadily again after 2003. The recent decline appears to be driven by higher mean growing season temperatures; interestingly, not only reductions in scraping damage but a period of cooler conditions were significant in explaining increases in C. mollis populations between 1997 and 2002. Our results demonstrate strong effects of introduced herbivores on both plant demography and population dynamics and show that climate-driven variation may counteract and mask positive responses to herbivore removal. Regional mean temperatures already have risen significantly over the last 50 years, suggesting that climate change could increasingly swamp the effects of management targeted at other environmental problems. Similar interactions between climate and invasive species will play an even greater role in future management, with long-term data sets like this critical to quantifying such effects.","[McEachern, A.

Net selection on plant traits, such as defensive chemistry, may be difficult to predict from studying either of these interactions in isolation. In this study, alkaloids were manipulated experimentally in the hemiparasitic annual plant Castilleja indivisa (Scrophulariaceae; Indian paintbrush) by growing these parasites with bitter (high-alkaloid) or sweet (low-alkaloid) near-isogenic lines of the host Lupinus albus (Fabaceae) in the field. To evaluate the effect of herbivores. half of the Indian paintbrush plants were randomly assigned to a reduced-herbivory treatment using insecticide, and the other half to a natural-herbivory treatment. Floral traits. bud and fruit herbivory, pollination, alkaloids, and plant performance were measured. These variables were used in a path analysis to dissect the direct and indirect effects of herbivory and pollination on lifetime seed set, and the direct and indirect effects of alkaloids on seed set via herbivory and pollination. Bud herbivory and fruit herbivory directly decreased seed production, whereas pollination had a direct positive effect. In addition, bud herbivory had negative indirect effects on seed set by reducing the number of open flowers, which reduced pollinator visits. Alkaloids directly reduced bud herbivory but did not significantly affect pollination or fruit herbivory directly. However, because bud herbivory indirectly reduced seed set by reducing pollinator visits to flowers. alkaloids also had additional indirect benefits for plants by increasing pollination. Overall. the net benefit of alkaloid uptake was due to both reduction in herbivory and an increase in pollinator visits to flowers. This study demonstrates the importance of considering multiple interactions simultaneously when attempting to understand the mechanisms underlying correlations between plant traits and fitness.","Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, 2320 Storer Hall,1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",lsadler@vt.edu,,"Strauss, Sharon/0000-0002-6117-4085",,,,NA,80,112,135,3,116,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2001,82,7,NA,,,,2032,2044,,,,,,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,457FC,NA,Green Submitted,NA,NA,7/1/24,WOS:000170125600020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Parasitic plants obtain water, sugar, nitrogen compounds, and a variety of secondary metabolites from their host plants. In a greenhouse study, I examined the direct interactions of a parasitic plant, Castilleja wightii (Scrophulariaceae), with three plant hosts and the indirect effects of this parasitism on the performance of a parasite-feeding herbivore. The three host species, Lupinus arboreus, Artemisia pycnocephala, and Eriophyllum staechadifolium, directly and differentially affected C. wightii flower production, although parasite biomass was not affected by host species. Surprisingly, parasite performance was weakest when attacking a leguminous host, although parasite total nitrogen was highest when growing on a legume. Parasites also exerted a strong direct effect on host performance: host dry mass was negatively correlated with parasite mass for all three host species tested. However, this effect differed among hosts: for E. staechadifolium, proportionately larger parasite mass was correlated with smaller overall biomass of the host and parasite combined, while for the other two hosts, overall host-parasite mass was not correlated with parasite mass, indicating that E. staechadifolium was more affected by parasite attack than were the other host species. Finally, host plant chemistry had strong indirect effects on the performance of an aphid, Nearctaphis kachena, that feeds on C. wightii. Aphids feeding on C. wightii that were parasitizing L. arboreus (alkaloid-producing, high nitrogen), A. pycnocephala (alkaloid-free, intermediate nitrogen), and E. staechadifolium (terpenoid-producing, low nitrogen) experienced 68.2, 65.3, and 49.5% survival, respectively. Further, aphids feeding on parasites using L. arboreus and A. pycnocephala produced 2.43 and 1.77 times more offspring on average than those feeding on parasites using E. staechadifolium. My results indicate that interactions between plant parasites and different host species can have strong direct effects on both host and parasite performance, as well as marked effects on the tritrophic interactions among plant hosts, parasitic plants, and their herbivores.",,,"Marvier, MA (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ, BIOL BOARD, SANTA CRUZ, CA 95064 USA.",,,"Marvier, Michelle/0000-0001-8360-9265",,,,NA,65,74,80,0,51,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1996,77,5,NA,,,,1398,1409,,10.2307/2265537,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2265537,,,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UX396,NA,,NA,NA,7/1/24,WOS:A1996UX39600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

To investigate the relative importance of plant traits in such interactions, we studied the role of the root hemiparasite, Castilleja levisecta (Orobanchaceae), as a mediator of interactions between the host plants it parasitizes and the lepidopteran herbivore Euphydryas editha (Nymphalidae), whose caterpillars feed on Castilleja and sequester iridoid glycosides from it. We tested whether the hemiparasite's size, leaf N concentration, and iridoid glycoside concentrations were influenced by the identity of its host plant, and then whether these traits influenced outcomes for the herbivore. We found that the hemiparasite's size and leaf N depended on the host it parasitized, and these traits in turn affected outcomes for E.editha. Specifically, Euphydryas editha survival increased with hemiparasite size and caterpillar mass increased with leaf N; caterpillars with greater mass were more likely to survive during diapause. We also found preliminary evidence that host identity influenced iridoid glycoside sequestration by the herbivore. Mean iridoid glycoside concentrations in caterpillars ranged from 1-12% depending on the host being parasitized by Castilleja. This study demonstrates that root parasitism can result in strong indirect effects on higher trophic levels, influencing organisms' survival, growth, and chemical interactions.","[Haan, Nathan L.; Bakker, Jonathan D.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 354115, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bowers, M.

Based on a well-resolved and well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis, we present a formal reclassification of the major lineages comprising the Castillejinae. Prior to this treatment, subtribe Castillejinae included Castilleja (ca. 190 spp.), Cordylanthus (18 spp.), Orthocarpus (9 spp.), Triphysaria (5 spp.), and the monotypic genera Clevelandia and Ophiocephalus. In the classification presented here, Orthocarpus and Triphysaria retain their current circumscriptions, Castilleja is expanded to include Clevelandia and Ophiocephalus, and Cordylanthus is split into three genera; a key to the genera as they are recognized here is provided. Two new combinations, Castilleja beldingii and Castilleja ophiocephala, are proposed within the expanded Castilleja. The concept of Cordylanthus is restricted to the 13 species formerly recognized as subg. Cordylanthus, while subg. Dicranostegia and subg. Hemistegia are elevated to genus level (Dicranostegia and Chloropyron, respectively). We resurrect the generic name Chloropyron for the halophytes previously recognized as subg. Hemistegia. Five new combinations are proposed for Chloropyron (Chloropyron maritimum subsp. canescens, Chloropyron maritimum subsp. palustre, Chloropyron molle subsp. hispidum, Chloropyron palmatum, and Chloropyron tecopense). In addition to the formal classification, we provide phylogenetic clade definitions for Castillejinae, each of the genera, and two additional clades that are not assigned formal ranks. Morphological characteristics used to recognize traditional groups are evaluated, and synapomorphies are discussed. Finally, the current infrageneric classifications for Castilleja and Cordylanthus are evaluated in light of the recent molecular phylogenetic analyses.","[Egger, J.

These results indicate that resistance trails such as alkaloids can increase plant fitness directly by reducing herbivore attack and indirectly by increasing pollinator visitation to defended plants. Thus, selection for production of secondary compounds may be underestimated by considering only the direct effect of herbivores on plant fitness.","Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Adler, LS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",lsadler@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,NA,47,70,77,0,56,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

Hummingbirds, the primary pollinators, usually did not visit flower species selectively, and individual birds often simultaneously carried 4 or more species of pollen. Flowers may have competed interspecifically for these shared pollinators, but competition was reduced because character displacement in orientation of anther and stigma resulted in some species using different parts of the bird to transport their pollen. Most flower species secreted nectar at similar rates, particularly when they bloomed together in mixed stands. A population of L. cardinalis secreted no nectar; it attracted hummingbirds by mimicing more abundant, nectar-producing species.

These cues can originate from tissues on the same plant or from different individuals. Since parasitic plants form vascular connections with their host, parasites have the potential to receive cues from hosts that allow them to adjust defenses against future herbivory. However, the role of plant communication between hosts and parasites for herbivore defense remains poorly investigated. Here, we examined the effects of damage to lupine hosts (Lupinus texensis) on responses of the attached hemiparasite (Castilleja indivisa), and indirectly, on a specialist herbivore of the parasite, buckeyes (Junonia coenia). Lupines produce alkaloids that act as defenses against herbivores that can be taken up by the parasite. We found that damage to lupine host plants by beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) significantly increased jasmonic acid (JA) levels in both the lupine host and parasite, suggesting uptake of phytohormones or priming of parasite defenses by using host cues. However, lupine host damage did not induce changes in alkaloid levels in the hosts or parasites. Interestingly, the parasite had substantially higher concentrations of JA and alkaloids compared to lupine host plants. Buckeye herbivores consumed more parasite tissue when attached to damaged compared to undamaged hosts. We hypothesize that increased JA due to lupine host damage induced higher iridoid glycosides in the parasite, which are feeding stimulants for this specialist herbivore. Our results demonstrate that damage to hosts may affect both parasites and associated herbivores, indicating cascading effects of host damage on multiple trophic levels.","[Tjiurutue, Muvari Connie; Adler, Lynn S.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, 221 Morrill Sci Ctr South,611 North Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Tjiurutue, Muvari Connie] Univ Namibia, Dept Chem & Biochem, 340 Mandume Ndemufayo Ave, Pionierspark, Windhoek, Namibia; [Stevenson, Philip C.] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Cent Ave, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England; [Stevenson, Philip C.] Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3AB, Surrey, England","University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Namibia; University of Greenwich; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew","Tjiurutue, MC (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, 221 Morrill Sci Ctr South,611 North Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Tjiurutue, MC (corresponding author), Univ Namibia, Dept Chem & Biochem, 340 Mandume Ndemufayo Ave, Pionierspark, Windhoek, Namibia.",connie.muv@gmail.com,"Stevenson, Philip C/E-8822-2013; stevenson, philip c/E-8741-2013","Stevenson, Philip C/0000-0002-0736-3619; stevenson, philip c/0000-0002-0736-3619","Fulbright Fellowship; Faculty for the Future Fellowship; Plant Biology Graduate program; USDA/CSREES [MAS000411]; USDA NRI [2008-02,346]",Fulbright Fellowship; Faculty for the Future Fellowship; Plant Biology Graduate program; USDA/CSREES(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); USDA NRI(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The study was funded by Fulbright Fellowship (MCT), Faculty for the Future Fellowship (MCT), Plant Biology Graduate program (MCT), USDA/CSREES (Hatch) MAS000411 (LSA) and USDA NRI 2008-02,346 (LSA).",NA,42,1,1,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,1573-1561,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

However, far fewer studies consider indirect facilitation, including the effect on plant-plant interactions of symbiosis with soil fungi. We asked whether the nurse shrub Hypericum laricifolium affected the colonization and activity of fungal symbionts of plants showing contrasting patterns of local spatial association with this nurse in four sites between 4100 and 4400 m in the tropical Andes. We selected three abundant herb species (Senecio wedglacialis, Castilleja fissifolia, and Agrostis tolucensis) which showed positive spatial associations with the shrub, and two herbs (Agrostis breviculmis and the exotic Rumex acetosella), which showed predominantly negative associations. We collected roots of these species from individuals under the shrub's crown and outside, and measured colonization and activity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and colonization of dark septate fungi (DSE), as well as glomalin content in soil samples from both study situations. We found no consistent effect of the nurse across species or elevations on the degree of AMF and DSE colonization, but there was a consistent increase in AMF phosphatase activity in plants positively associated with the shrub, as well as an increase in the content of easily extractable glomalin in soils under its influence across elevations. Thus, our results suggest that an increased AMF metabolic activity and soil stabilization mediated by the increase in extractable glomalin could be linked with an indirect facilitation effect of this nurse shrub on its beneficiary plants.","[Caceres-Mago, Karla; Caceres, Alicia] Univ Cent Venezuela, Fac Ciencias, Inst Biol Expt, Caracas, Venezuela; [Llambi, Luis D.] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Ecol, Merida 5101, Venezuela",University of Central Venezuela; University of Los Andes Venezuela,"Cáceres-Mago, K (corresponding author), Univ Cent Venezuela, Fac Ciencias, Inst Biol Expt, Caracas, Venezuela.",kcaceresmago@gmail.com,,"Caceres-Mago, Karla/0000-0003-3782-1489",,,,NA,64,2,3,2,29,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",1664-2201,1664-221X,,ALPINE BOT,Alp.

Thus, it is likely that the interactions among plants, mutualists, and other selective agents, such as antagonists, ultimately shape the evolution of floral and flowering traits. We examined the importance of pollination vs pre-dispersal seed predation to selection on plant and floral characters via female plant-reproductive success in Castilleja linariaefolia (Scrophulariaceae). C. linariaefolia is pollinated by hummingbirds and experiences high levels of pre-dispersal seed predation by plume moth and fly larvae in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA, where this work was conducted. We first examined whether female reproduction in C. linariaefolia was limited by pollination. Supplemental pollination only marginally increased components of female reproduction, likely because seed predation masked, in part, the beneficial effects of pollen addition. In unmanipulated populations, we measured calyx length, flower production, and plant height and used path analysis combined with structural equation modeling to quantify their importance to relative seed set through pathways involving pollination vs seed predation. We found that the strength of selection on calyx length, flower production, and plant height was greater for seed predation pathways than for pollination pathways, and one character, calyx length, experienced opposing selection via pollination vs seed predation. These results suggest that the remarkable intraspecific variation in plant and floral characters exhibited by some flowering plants is likely the result of selection driven, at least in part, by pollinators in concert with antagonists, such as pre-dispersal seed predators. This work highlights the subtle but complex interactions that shape floral and vegetative design in natural ecosystems.","Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA",,"Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA.",rirwin@arches.uga.edu,"Cariveau, Daniel/AAB-9336-2020",,,,,NA,72,152,178,3,111,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2004,104,1,NA,,,,15,26,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12641.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12641.x,,,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,762FY,NA,,NA,NA,7/1/24,WOS:000187962200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study explores whether geographic variation in pollinator interactions underlies the observed patterns of floral divergence both 1) among species of the Castilleja purpurea complex (C. purpurea, C. citrina and C. lindheimeri) and the congener C. sessiliflora, as well as 2) within C. sessiliflora, across its wide geographic range. We sampled floral visitors and floral traits (morphology and color) at 23 populations across a 1900 km-wide study area in 1-3 years, with reproductive fitness (fruit set) data for 18 of these populations. A wide diversity of pollinator functional groups visited the focal species, including bees, butterflies, hawkmoths and hummingbirds, and visitor assemblages varied among species and across geography. We identified relationships between floral traits and visitation by certain pollinator groups, which often aligned with predictions based on pollination syndromes. Despite visitor assemblages being largely generalized across most populations, we found that the observed changes in floral traits were associated with shifts in the relative frequencies of key pollinator functional groups. Hence this study demonstrates that variation in pollinator assemblages across the distributions of taxa may underlie divergence in floral traits and suggests that highly specialized relationships may not be required for early stages of pollinator-mediated floral divergence. Our extensive sampling of 23 populations over multiple years across a large geographic area highlights the value of range-wide studies for characterizing patterns of divergence mediated by ecological interactions.","[Wenzell, Katherine E.] John Innes Ctr, Colney Lane, Norwich, England; [Wenzell, Katherine E.; Skogen, Krissa A.; Fant, Jeremie B.] Northwestern Univ, Program Plant Biol & Conservat, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Wenzell, Katherine E.; Skogen, Krissa A.; Fant, Jeremie B.] Negaunee Inst Plant Conservat Sci & Act, Chicago Bot Garden, Glencoe, IL 60035 USA; [Skogen, Krissa A.] Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clemson, SC USA",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); John Innes Center; Northwestern University; Clemson University,"Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), John Innes Ctr, Colney Lane, Norwich, England.;Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Program Plant Biol & Conservat, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), Negaunee Inst Plant Conservat Sci & Act, Chicago Bot Garden, Glencoe, IL 60035 USA.",kewenzell@gmail.com,,"Fant, Jeremie/0000-0001-9276-1111; Skogen, Krissa/0000-0002-7868-9632; Wenzell, Katherine/0000-0002-1635-5485","Botanical Society of America; American Society of Plant Taxonomists; American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant; Friends of Nachusa Grasslands; Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1842165]; NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates site award [DBI-461007, DBI-1757800]; Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation and Action at the Chicago Botanic Garden",Botanical Society of America; American Society of Plant Taxonomists; American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant; Friends of Nachusa Grasslands; Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates site award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation and Action at the Chicago Botanic Garden,"Funding was provided by the Botanical Society of America, American Society of Plant Taxonomists, American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant, Friends of Nachusa Grasslands, Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship award (DGE-1842165) to KEW.

This dual action suggests particular sensitivity of the parasite to climate change and any associated impacts on hosts and other members of the community. While little research has addressed the responses of parasitic plants to climate change in natural environments, impacts are predicted from controlled environment studies together with a knowledge of the key ecophysiological traits of hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae, in particular of Striga species, which are important weeds in semi-arid tropical agro-ecosystems, and Rhinanthus species, which can be important components of (principally) grassland communities in the northern temperate zone. The main mode of action of both elevated CO2 and warming will be through changes in photosynthesis and stomatal functioning. Enhanced photosynthesis of the hemiparasite and host will increase parasite carbon gains but may also increase the demand for host mineral nutrients. Mineral nutrition may, therefore, mediate the impacts of climate change on host-parasite associations. The relative insensitivity of hemiparasite stomata to elevated CO2 suggests that high stomatal conductances may be maintained and thus solute uptake may become limited by soil drying driven by higher rates of evapotranspiration and reduced precipitation. Climate change impacts on host-parasite interactions at the individual level will ultimately affect hemiparasite impacts at the community level. Community impacts will be greatest where climate change considerably favours hemiparasite populations or, conversely, causes them to disappear from communities where they were formerly abundant. Impacts will further be mediated by climate impacts on hosts, and the natural enemies of hosts and parasites alike. Further, the wide host range of many root hemiparasitic plants may facilitate migration of their populations through new communities under a changing climate.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",m.c.press@sheffield.ac.uk,"Press, Malcolm Colin/ABB-3995-2021","Phoenix, Gareth/0000-0002-0911-8107",,,,NA,60,26,30,1,64,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1211-9520,1874-9348,,FOLIA GEOBOT,Folia Geobot.,,2005,40,3-Feb,NA,,,,205,216,,10.1007/BF02803235,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02803235,,,12,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Plant Sciences,945YZ,NA,,NA,NA,7/1/24,WOS:000230540200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

These traits have important impacts on host plants and non-host plants, and influence interactions with other trophic levels. Ultimately, they can affect community structure and functioning. Here, we review these physiological traits and discuss their ecological consequences. 2 The root hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae form a convenient subset of the parasitic angiosperms for study because: they are the most numerous and most widely distributed group of parasitic angiosperms; their physiological characteristics have been well studied; they are important in both agricultural and (semi)natural communities; and they are tractable as experimental organisms. 3 Key traits include: high transpiration rates; competition with the host for nutrients and haustorial metabolism of host-derived solutes; uptake of host-derived secondary metabolites; dual autotrophic and heterotrophic carbon nutrition; distinct carbohydrate biochemistry; high nutrient concentrations in green leaf tissue and leaf litter; and small (often hairless and non-mycorrhizal) roots. 4 Impacts on the host are detrimental, which can alter competitive balances between hosts and non-hosts and thus result in community change. Further impacts may result from effects on the abiotic environment, including soil water status, nutrient cycling and leaf/canopy temperatures. 5 However, for non-host species and for organisms that interact with these (e.g. herbivores and pollinators) or for those that benefit from changes in the abiotic environment, the parasites may have an overall positive effect, suggesting that at the community level, hemiparasites may also be considered as mutualists. 6 It is clear that through their distinctive suite of physiological traits hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae, have considerable impacts on community structure and function, can have both competitive and positive interactions with other plants, and can impact on other trophic levels. Many community level effects of parasitic plants can be considered analogous to those of other parasites, predators or herbivores.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",m.c.press@sheffield.ac.uk,"Press, Malcolm Colin/ABB-3995-2021","Phoenix, Gareth/0000-0002-0911-8107",,,,NA,102,71,85,0,72,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.
