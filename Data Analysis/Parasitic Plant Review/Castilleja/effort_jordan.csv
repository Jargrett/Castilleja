The aim of this study was to determine the morphological characters of C. nervata in order to differentiate it from C. arvensis, to identify C. tenuiflora var. xylorrhiza as part of the C. tenuiflora complex and separate the latter from C. integrifolia var. integrifolia, as well as showing the geographic distribution and documenting the morphological similitude of these taxa. Methods: Herbaria specimens were revised and the taxa were collected, in addition to measuring and characterizing the morphological structures of the specimens found in the National Park Cafion del Rio Blanco, which were determined based on literature. Key results: Two taxa of the genus Castilleja unreported previously for the flora of the state of Veracruz, Mexico were identified. Two comparative tables for the identification of the taxa corresponding to the C. tenuiflora complex and for distinguishing between C. arvensis y C. nervata are presented. Photographs and a map of distribution of the new records are also provided. Conclusions: These taxa belong to the 10 species and eight varieties of the genus Castilleja present in Veracruz.

These processes are frequently invoked for Castilleja (Indian paintbrushes) as contributors to morphological and genetic novelty and as complicating factors in species delimitations. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of morphological and genetic evidence for hybridization in a well-characterized hybrid swarm involving three broadly sympatric species (C. miniata, C. rhexiifolia, C. sulphurea) in western Colorado. Field-classified hybrids are present at high frequencies at these sites and show morphological intermediacy to and segregate for chloroplast DNA haplotypes with C. rhexiifolia and C. sulphurea. Contrarily, DNA content and AFLP variation show that field-classified hybrids are not recent hybrids but a distinctive fourth taxon. Actual hybrids (plants showing admixture >= 10% for two genotypic groups) comprised 13% of our sample, with most admixture involving C. rhexiifolia, C. sulphurea, and the unknown taxon. The identity of the field-classified hybrids remains unknown; they either represent a stabilized hybrid species or a species with uncharacteristically high diversity for color alleles. This study highlights the importance of examining concordance and discordance between morphology, cytology, and genetic criteria to understand the complex evolutionary history of diverse groups such as Castilleja.","[Hersch-Green, Erika I.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Cronn, Richard] US Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Northern Arizona University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service","Hersch-Green, EI (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol, S Beaver St Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.","erikahersch@gmail.com","","Cronn, Richard/0000-0001-5342-3494; Hersch-Green, Erika/0000-0003-3887-0768","","","",NA,"99","22","26","1","17","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0002-9122","1537-2197","","AM J BOT","Am.

Homoploid hybrid species are generally detected via the presence of genetic additivity of parental markers, novel ecological and spatial distinctions, and novel morphological traits, all of which may aid in the successful establishment of hybrid species from parental types. Speciation and diversification within the genus Castilleja (Orobanchaceae) has been attributed to high levels of hybridization and polyploidy, though currently there are no examples of homoploid hybrid speciation within the genus. We employed multiple lines of evidence to examine a putative hybrid origin in C. christii, a rare endemic, known only from 80 hectares at the summit of Mt. Harrison (Cassia Co., Idaho). Methods: We used granule-bound starch synthase II (waxy) sequences and 26 morphological characters to address hybridization between C. christii and widespread congeners C. miniata and/or C. linariifolia in an area of sympatry. Chromosomes of C. christii were also counted for the first time. Key results: All 230 direct-sequenced C. christii individuals had the additive genomes of both C. miniata and C. linariifolia. Castilleja christii shares traits with both parents but also has floral characters that are unique and transgressive. Cytological counts indicated that all three taxa are diploid. Conclusions: We conclude that C. christii is a stabilized homoploid hybrid derivative of C. linariifolia and C. miniata and is likely following an independent evolutionary trajectory from its progenitors.","[Clay, Danielle L.; Novak, Stephen J.; Serpe, Marcelo D.; Smith, James F.] Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Tank, David C.] Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Tank, David C.] Univ Idaho, Stillinger Herbarium, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Idaho; Boise State University; Idaho; University of Idaho; Idaho; University of Idaho","Clay, DL (corresponding author), Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1910 Univ Dr, Boise, ID 83725 USA.","Danielle.L.Clay@gmail.com","","","Boise State University, Department of Biological Sciences, a National Science Foundation [GK-12]; Northwest Scientific Association Student Research Grant Award; Boise State University Graduate Student Research Grant; Idaho Native Plant Society Education, Research, and Inventory Grant; U.

Field-captured adult butterflies contained the major iridoid glycosides (catalpol and macfadienoside) of the Castilleja. The content of a third iridoid glycoside, methyl shanzhiside, was also relatively high in the collected butterflies even though most individual Castilleja plants at Burnt Mill contained little or no methyl shanzhiside. Only a few plants, restricted to a small area, did contain appreciable methyl shanzhiside. Most of the plants that lacked the ester methyl shanzhiside contained shanzhiside, the corresponding free carboxylic acid. Thessalia larvae did not normally methylate the acid to produce methyl shanzhiside. Larvae that stopped feeding at an early instar, but yet survived several weeks, did contain major amounts of methyl shanzhiside. It is suggested that only larvae that overwinter or otherwise enter diapause convert shanzhiside to methyl shanzhiside. The Castilleja food plant also contained iridoids other than catalpol and macfadienoside, sometimes in major amounts, but these were never found in larvae, pupae, or butterflies.","COLORADO STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,FT COLLINS,CO 80523","Colorado State University","","","","","","","",NA,"14","14","15","0","9","PLENUM PUBL CORP","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013","0098-0331","","","J CHEM ECOL","J.

Herein we report the antidepressant activity of the methanol extract from the leaves of this medicinal plant. The oral administration of MeOH extract (500 mg/kg) induced a significant (p < 0.05) decrement of the immobility parameter on Forced Swimming Test (FST) and an increment in the latency and duration of the hypnosis, induced by administration of sodium pentobarbital (Pbi, 40 mg/ kg, i.p.). Chemical analysis of this antidepressant extract allowed the isolation of (+)-piperitol-4-O-xylopyranosyl-(1 -> 6)-O-glucopyranoside. This new furofuran lignan diglycoside was named tenuifloroside (1) and its complete chemical structure elucidation on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR spectra analysis of the natural compound 1 and its peracetylated derivative 1a is described. This compound was found together with two flavones-apigenin and luteolin 5-methyl ether-a phenylethanoid- verbascoside-and three iridoids-geniposide, caryoptoside and aucubin. All these compounds were purified by successive normal and reverse phase column chromatography. Tenuifloroside, caryoptoside and luteolin 5-methyl ether were isolated from Castilleja genus for the first time. These findings demonstrate that C. tenuiflora methanol extract has beneficial effect on depressive behaviors, and the knowledge of its chemical constitution allows us to propose a new standardized treatment for future investigations of this species in depressive illness.","[Herrera-Ruiz, Maribel; Lopez-Rodriguez, Ricardo; Gonzalez-Cortazar, Manases; Tortoriello, Jaime; Zamilpa, Alejandro] Inst Mexicano Seguro Social, Ctr Invest Biomed Sur, Argentina 1, Xochitepec 62790, Morelos, Mexico; [Lopez-Rodriguez, Ricardo; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot, Dept Biotechnol, Yautepec 62730, Morelos, Mexico; [Eda Dominguez-Mendoza, Blanca] Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, Lab RMN, Ctr Invest Quim, Cuernavaca 62210, Morelos, Mexico","Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social; Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos","Zamilpa, A (corresponding author), Inst Mexicano Seguro Social, Ctr Invest Biomed Sur, Argentina 1, Xochitepec 62790, Morelos, Mexico.","cibis_herj@yahoo.com.mx; richard_lorr@hotmail.com; gttapia@ipn.mx; bed@uaem.mx; gmanases@hotmail.com; jtortora2@yahoo.es; azamilpa_2000@yahoo.com.mx","González-Cortazar, Manasés/AAL-6644-2020; Zamilpa, Alejandro/AAC-2241-2019; Dominguez-Mendoza, Blanca Eda/AAQ-8486-2021; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela/M-3725-2013","González-Cortazar, Manasés/0000-0002-3693-1670; Zamilpa, Alejandro/0000-0002-2233-5958; Dominguez-Mendoza, Blanca Eda/0000-0003-4083-9049; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela/0000-0002-7479-9332; TORTORIELLO, JAIME/0000-0002-1597-7645","Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS-Mexico) [99185919]; CONACYT-Mexico Grant [478597]; Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del Instituto Politecnico Nacional [1623-2015]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT-Mexico) [220007]","Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS-Mexico); CONACYT-Mexico Grant; Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del Instituto Politecnico Nacional; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT-Mexico)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))","This work was supported by Basic grant from Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS-Mexico, 99185919) and CONACYT-Mexico Grant (478597) for Master Studies of Ricardo Lopez-Rodriguez.

Subsequent to the elimination of goats from the island in 1992, many populations of C. grisea have reappeared and have been increasing in size. Methods Nineteen populations were surveyed for their genotype at 19 allozyme loci. Key Results At the taxon level, 57.9 % of loci are polymorphic with A(P) = 3.09 and HE = 0.137. Populations averaged 33.0 % polymorphic loci with A(P) = 2.43 and HE = 0.099. Most variation is found within rather than among populations (G(ST) = 0.128), although differentiation among populations is significant. Genetic identities range from I = 0.960 to I = 1.000 with mean I = 0.990. There is no significant relationship between genetic and geographic distance. Gene flow among populations is Nm = 2.50 based on private alleles and Nm = 1.70 based on F-ST. Outcrossing rates based on fixation indices average t = 1.01, indicating a primarily outcrossed mating system. e Conclusions The observed genetic variation is moderately high, unusually so for an insular endemic species, suggesting that C. grisea may not have lost substantial genetic variation during 150 years of overgrazing, and indicating that it is unlikely to be endangered by genetic factors.","Univ S Dakota, Dept Biol, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA","University of South Dakota","Helenurm, K (corresponding author), Univ S Dakota, Dept Biol, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA.","helenurm@usd.edu","","","","","",NA,"40","12","14","0","4","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0305-7364","","","ANN BOT-LONDON","Ann.

During the cytological studies we also came across pollen mother cells showing meiotic abnormalities such as cytomixis, chromatin stickiness and anaphase bridges with lagging chromatin. Consequently microsporogenesis was also irregular showing dyads and triads. However, the percentage of these irregularities during meiosis and microsporogenesis was not higher, and pollen fertility was not affected to a great extent. Cytomixis and other meiotic abnormalities in these species are reported here for the first time.","[Ruben Andrada, Aldo; de los Angeles Paez, Valeria; Caro, M.

(Orobanchaceae) is a perennial shrub used since the 16th century in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of a number of health disorders including inflammation, stomach pain and tumors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcerogenic activities of ethyl acetate (EaE), methanol (ME) and aqueous extracts (AE) of Castilleja tenuiflora wild grown (CtW) and in vitro plants (CtIv). Material and method: Phytochemical analysis of the phenylethanoid glycoside (PhG) and iridoid glycoside (IG) components was carried out by chromatographic methods. In vitro cytotoxic activity of the extracts was evaluated in the following four carcinoma cell lines: colon (HF-6), breast (MCF-7), prostate (PC-3), and nasophatyngeal (KB). The topical anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in mouse ear edema induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Anti-ulcerogenic activity was evaluated in rats using an absolute ethanol-induced acute gastric ulcer model. Results: The main compounds in the extracts were isoverbascoside, verbascoside and aucubin and their concentration depended both on the solvent used and on the plant material origin. None of the extracts showed cytotoxicity against the tested cell lines. In contrast, CtWEaE, CtWAE and CtIvEaE (1.6 mg/ear) showed moderate anti-inflammatory activity similar to dexamethasone (1 mg/ear) with a 382, 39.3 and 49.1% decrease of inflammation, respectively. CtWEaE and CtIvEaE (100 mg/kg) showed high anti-ulcerogenic activity with 88.3 and 83.1% inhibition, respectively, compared to famotidine (20 mg/kg, 32.8% inhibition). Conclusion: Castilleja tenuiflora extracts provided significant gastric protection in an acute induction model and topical anti-inflammatory activity in a mouse ear edema model. These activities are related to verbascoside and may explain the traditional use of Castilleja tenuiflora in the treatment anti-inflammatory and gastrointestinal disorders. Cultured Castilleja tenuiflora plants (in vitro) exhibited pharmacological activities and also have the potential to produce bioactive compounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Castilleja affinis ssp. neglecta is a serpentine endemic species, known from six sites within the San Francisco Bay Area and is the focus of active restoration efforts. It grows sympatrically with the subspecies, C. affinis ssp. affinis, which is more widespread but differs in floral color and soil preference. In this study, we used morphometric measurements (three bract, ten floral, and two leaf measurements) and microsatellite markers to determine (1) how the two subspecies differ, (2) if there is evidence of hybridization and (3) quantify the genetic structure of known populations of C. affinis ssp. neglecta. We found that all 15 morphological measurements differed significantly between the subspecies and neutral genetic markers show strong genetic differentiation. Overall we found C. affinis ssp. neglecta populations had similar levels of genetic diversity and genetic differentiation between populations but higher inbreeding than compared to its more common congener. Two populations of C. affinis ssp. neglecta showed lower genetic differentiation from the C. affinis ssp. affinis populations, with some individuals showing considerable overlap in genotypic diversity, hence we cannot rule out historic or low levels hybridization in those populations. Castilleja affinis ssp. neglecta is a federally endangered species that would benefit from restoration efforts that aims to maintain genetic diversity while minimizing inbreeding in reintroduction efforts.","[Widener, Laney; Fant, Jeremie B.] Chicago Bot Garden, Plant Sci & Conservat, 1000 Lake Cook Rd, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA; [Widener, Laney; Fant, Jeremie B.] Northwestern Univ, Plant Biol & Conservat, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Widener, Laney] New England Wild Flower Soc, Framingham, MA 01701 USA","Northwestern University","Widener, L (corresponding author), Chicago Bot Garden, Plant Sci & Conservat, 1000 Lake Cook Rd, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA.;Widener, L (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Plant Biol & Conservat, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Widener, L (corresponding author), New England Wild Flower Soc, Framingham, MA 01701 USA.","lwidener@u.northwestern.edu; jfant@chicagobotanic.org","Fant, Jeremie B/AAA-4962-2019","Fant, Jeremie B/0000-0001-9276-1111","Creekside Science; California Native Plant Society","Creekside Science; California Native Plant Society","This study would not be possible without the support from the Creekside Science, who provided the grounds for the study, financial support for the lab work, and hours organizing and collecting data in the field for the endangered C. affinis ssp. neglecta with us.

The main objective of this study was to develop ex situ and in situ conservation through micropropagation and field plantings. In vitro cultures were initiated using nodal explants from two plants raised from seeds collected from a natural population. Shoots were then multiplied on Murashige and Skoog basal medium with 2.0 mu mol L-1 6-benzylaminopurine (BA), 3.0 mu mol L-1 kinetin (Kn), 2.2 g L-1 phytagel, and 3% sucrose. Explant position on source plants, culture vessel design, and application of different plant growth regulator levels for BA, Kn, and thiadiazuron (TDZ) were tested to optimize micropropagation protocols. Clones from the plants showed differences in plant height and number of nodes in response to various BA and TDZ concentrations. In vitro shoots were successfully rooted under ex vitro conditions using commercial rooting powder (0.8% indole-3-butyric acid) with an average of similar to 17 roots per shoot and acclimatized in the greenhouse with 100% survival rate. Two-month-old plants were transferred to a Parks Canada restoration site at Fort Rodd Hill, Victoria, BC, with 7.5% survival. The use of micropropagation in combination with reintroduction efforts offers an excellent opportunity for conserving endangered plant biodiversity in vitro and facilitating in situ conservation efforts by providing plants for reintroduction.","[Salama, Ahmed; Shukla, Mukund R.; Jones, Maxwell P.; Saxena, Praveen K.] Univ Guelph, Gosling Res Inst Plant Preservat, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Popova, Elena] Global Crop Divers Trust, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Fisk, Nathan S.] Pk Canada, 603 Ft Rodd Hill Rd, Victoria, BC V9C 2W8, Canada","University of Guelph","Saxena, PK (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Gosling Res Inst Plant Preservat, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.","psaxena@uoguelph.ca","Popova, Elena/N-6408-2019","Popova, Elena/0000-0002-4655-6974","Gosling Foundation, Guelph, ON","Gosling Foundation, Guelph, ON","This research was supported by the grants from the Gosling Foundation, Guelph, ON, to the Gosling Research Institute for Plant Preservation (GRIPP).",NA,"45","5","7","0","20","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS","OTTAWA","65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA","0008-4220","1918-1833","","CAN J PLANT SCI","Can.

Here, we show that N deficiency stimulates PhGs biosynthesis by increasing the activity of PAL. The contents of two PhGs, verbascoside and isoverbascoside, were enhanced under N deficiency compared with control conditions. The maximum PAL activity in shoots cultured under N deficiency was also increased. Furthermore, we found de novo anthocyanin synthesis under N deficiency suggesting an additional impact of this stress factor on flavonoid metabolism. N deficiency negatively affected the shoot growth (length, biomass, and total chlorophyll content) and multiplication rate, and inhibited the root formation of C. tenuiflora shoots.

Nels., and the annual hemiparasite Orthocarpus purpurascens Benth. grown either without or with a host plant. In addition, the effects of the hemiparasites on the host plants were investigated. All four hemiparasites could grow without a host, indicating that they are facultative parasites; O. purpurascens and C. chromosa produced flowers without a host. However, shoot mass of parasites with a host was 3-41 times that of parasites without a host. For C. miniata, C. chromosa, and O. purpurascens the growth of parasites grown with the legume Medicago sativa L. was compared with that of parasites grown with the grass Lolium perenne L. The legume was consistently a more beneficial host than the grass. In C. miniata and C. chromosa, patterns of biomass allocation were also influenced by the host type. The proportion of biomass allocated to roots was lower in parasites grown with the legume than in plants without a host, whereas it was higher in parasites grown with the grass. The parasites had strong negative effects on host growth, but the extent of host damage depended on the particular parasite-host combination. Castilleja chromosa and O. purpurascens affected the growth of the legume more strongly than that of the grass, whereas C. miniata affected the grass more strongly than the legume. Grasses parasitized by C. miniata allocated more biomass to roots than unparasitized grasses. In the other parasite-host associations the pattern of biomass allocation of the host was not influenced by parasitization. Because the biomass produced by the four hemiparasites was lower than the reduction in host biomass caused by parasitism, the parasites reduced total productivity.

To determine the effects of hemiparasitism on the population dynamics of the parasite, we identified a set of potential hosts and quantified their effects on the vital rates of C. tenuiflora during 2016-2018. Connections between the roots of the hemiparasite and the hosts were confirmed with a scanning electron microscope. Annual matrices considering two conditions (with and without potential hosts) were built based on vital rates for each year, and annual stochastic finite rate growth rates (lambda(s)) were calculated. Plants produced more reproductive structures with hosts than without hosts. A Life Table Response Experiment (LTRE) was performed to compare the contributions of vital rates between conditions. We identified 19 species of potential hosts for this generalist hemiparasite. Stochastic lambda with hosts lambda(s) = 1.02 (CI = 0.9999, 1.1) tended to be higher than without them lambda(s) = 0.9503 (CI = 0.9055, 0.9981). The highest elasticity values correspond to survival. LTRE indicated that the most important parameters are survival and fecundity; the total contribution of fecundity (0.0192) to the difference in growth was three times lower than that of survival (0.0603). Piqueria trinervia was the most abundant host, and C. tenuiflora had a higher lambda with it than with other species. Individuals can grow alone, but hosts can have a positive effect on the vital parameters of C. tenuiflora and on lambda.","[Granados-Hernandez, Luisa A.; Pisanty, Irene] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Av Univ 3000,Cd Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Raventos, Jose] Univ Alicante, Dept Ecol, Alicante, Spain; [Marquez-Guzman, Judith] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Comparada, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Mandujano, Maria C.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Biodiversidad, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universitat d'Alacant; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","Pisanty, I (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Av Univ 3000,Cd Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.","ipisanty@unam.mx","","Mandujano, Maria C./0000-0001-9855-6645; Granados-Hernandez, Luisa A./0000-0002-7204-9327","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Programa de Apoyo a Estudiantes de Posgrado; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia [432340]","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico(Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico); Programa de Apoyo a Estudiantes de Posgrado; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Programa de Apoyo a Estudiantes de Posgrado; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Grant/Award Number: 432340",NA,"66","2","2","3","11","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1438-3896","1438-390X","","POPUL ECOL","Popul.

Castilleja tenuiflora Benth. (Orobanchaceae) is used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and nervous disorders. Previous studies indicated that organic extracts from C. tenuiflora had gastroprotective effects and antidepressant activity. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the gastroprotective and antidepressant activity of fractions and isolated compounds from the methanolic extract (MECt) of C. tenuiflora in stressed mice. Chromatographic fractionation of MECt produced four fractions (FCt-1, FCt-2, CFt-3, and FCt-4) as well as four bioactive compounds which were identified using TLC, HPLC and NMR analyses. The cold restraint stress (CRS)-induced gastric ulcer model followed by the tail suspension test and the forced swim test were used to evaluate the gastroprotective effect and antidepressant activity of the extract fractions. FCt-2 and FCt-3 at 100 mg/kg had significant gastroprotective and antidepressant effects. All isolated compounds (verbascoside, teniufloroside and mixture geniposide/ musseanoside) displayed gastroprotective effects and antidepressant activity at 1 or 2 mg/kg. The above results allow us to conclude that these polyphenols and iridoids from C. tenuiflora are responsible for the gastroprotective and antidepressant effects.","[Lopez-Rodriguez, Ricardo; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot, Yautepec 62731, Morelos, Mexico; [Lopez-Rodriguez, Ricardo; Herrera-Ruiz, Maribel; Gonzalez-Cortazar, Manases; Zamilpa, Alejandro] Inst Mexicano Seguro Social, Ctr Invest Biomed Sur, Argentina 1, Xochitepec 62790, Morelos, Mexico; [Eda Dominguez-Mendoza, Blanca] Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, Ctr Invest Quim, Av Univ 1001, Cuernavaca 62209, Morelos, Mexico","Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social; Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos","Trejo-Tapia, G (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot, Yautepec 62731, Morelos, Mexico.;Zamilpa, A (corresponding author), Inst Mexicano Seguro Social, Ctr Invest Biomed Sur, Argentina 1, Xochitepec 62790, Morelos, Mexico.","richard_lorr@hotmail.com; cibis_herj@yahoo.com.mx; gttapia@ipn.mx; bed@uaem.mx; gmanases2000@gmail.com; azamilpa_2000@yahoo.com.mx","González-Cortazar, Manasés/AAL-6644-2020; Zamilpa, Alejandro/AAC-2241-2019; Dominguez-Mendoza, Blanca Eda/AAQ-8486-2021; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela/M-3725-2013","González-Cortazar, Manasés/0000-0002-3693-1670; Zamilpa, Alejandro/0000-0002-2233-5958; Dominguez-Mendoza, Blanca Eda/0000-0003-4083-9049; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela/0000-0002-7479-9332; Lopez Rodriguez, Ricardo/0000-0003-2202-8584","Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado-IPN [20170496, 20180034]; CONACyT-Mexico [220007]; Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social [FIS/IMSS/PROT/G18/1805]","Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado-IPN; CONACyT-Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social","This research was funded by Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado-IPN Grant number: 20170496 and 20180034, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social Grant number: FIS/IMSS/PROT/G18/1805 and CONACyT-Mexico Grant number: 220007.",NA,"43","16","16","1","13","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1420-3049","","","MOLECULES","Molecules","APR 2","2019","24","7",NA,"","","","","","1292","10.3390/molecules24071292","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules24071292","","","13","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry","HU0FY","30987044","Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000464948000004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Host species could affect parasite interactions with both herbivores and pollinators due to the uptake of defensive compounds and nutrients. However, the effects of different host species on parasitic plants have not been experimentally tested in the field. I determined the effect of two native host species, an alkaloid-producing, nitrogen-fixing lupine and non-alkaloid, non-nitrogen-fixing grass, on herbivory, pollination, and reproduction of the hemiparasitic plant Indian paintbrush (Castilleja indivisa). Within this experiment, I manipulated herbivory and pollination to determine their effects on Indian paintbrush reproduction. Indian paintbrush parasitizing lupines produced three times as many seeds and were more attractive to pollinators than Indian paintbrush parasitizing grass. However, there was no effect of host species on early season or floral herbivory. In addition, MANOVA revealed that host species influenced the response of Indian paintbrush female reproduction to experimentally manipulated herbivory and pollination treatments. Thus, the effect of hosts on parasites is mediated by interactions with herbivores and pollinators, and both direct and indirect effects may shape the selective pressures mediating interactions between hosts and parasites.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University","Adler, LS (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.","lsadler@vt.edu","","","","","",NA,"91","34","40","2","69","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0012-9658","","","ECOLOGY","Ecology","AUG","2003","84","8",NA,"","","","2083","2091","","10.1890/02-0542","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-0542","","","9","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","717EQ",NA,"Green Submitted",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000185073100016","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Pollination syndromes in Castilleja have been distinguished based on floral traits and historical observations of floral visitors. Here we addressed these questions: (1) Can pollination syndromes be distinguished using floral morphological traits or volatile organic compound emissions? (2) Is there significant variation in floral traits within a pollination syndrome at the level of populations or species? (3) Do pollination syndromes predict the most frequent floral visitor to Castilleja? Methods Floral traits and visitation were measured for five co-occurring Castilleja species (C. applegatei, C. linariifolia, C. miniata, C. nana, and C. peirsonii), representing three pollination syndromes (bee, fly, and hummingbird), at four sites in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and multiple linear regressions to address key questions in the differentiation of Castilleja and floral visitors. Results Our analyses revealed that both morphological traits and floral VOCs can be used to distinguish between some pollination syndromes and Castilleja species. Morphological traits defined pollination syndromes reliably, but within the hummingbird syndrome, there was also significant variation among populations and species. Pollination syndrome was a poor predictor of visitors to Castilleja. Conclusions Floral trait differentiation among Castilleja individuals reflects both taxonomy and pollination syndromes. Differentiation was generally more evident in morphological traits compared to VOCs. Furthermore, a priori notions of pollination syndromes in this system are overly simplistic and fail to predict which animals most frequently visit Castilleja in natural populations.","[Hilpman, Evan T.; Busch, Jeremiah W.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Washington State University","Hilpman, ET (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.","evan.hilpman@gmail.com","","Hilpman, Evan/0000-0003-1668-426X","NSF [DEB 1457037]; Betty Higinbotham Fellowship","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Betty Higinbotham Fellowship","Research was supported by NSF DEB 1457037 and the Betty Higinbotham Fellowship.

Ipomopsis flowers were hand-pollinated with either purr conspecific pollen (the control) or with C. linariaefolia pollen applied prior to, simultaneously with, or following conspecific pollen. Flowers that were simultaneously given C. linariaefolia and I, aggregata pollen received 39% less conspecific pollen than flowers in the control, but did not set fewer seeds per fruit. Flowers that were given C. linariaefolia pollen first received 30% less conspecific pollen and set 38% fewer seeds per fruit than the control. These results suggest that there is a priority effect; deposition of C. linariaefolia pollen on I. aggregata flowers results in competition, but only when C. linariaefolia pollen is deposited first. Unlike pollen of another competitor of I. aggregata (Delphinium nelsonii Greene. Per.), C, linariaefolia pollen caused competition without inducing an increased rate of stigma closure. Only 12% of I. aggregata's stigmas closed when C. linariaefolia pollen was deposited, and seed set of I. aggregata was reduced relative to the control whether their stigmas closed or not. The low rate at which C. linariaefolia pollen induces closure of I. aggregata's stigmas could be an adaptation to reduce the negative effects of competition.","Univ Illinois, Shelford Vivarium, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Grinnell Coll, Dept Biol, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA.","carusoc@grinnell.edu","","Caruso, Christina/0000-0001-7069-9572","","","",NA,"44","59","68","0","20","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING","OTTAWA","65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA","0008-4026","","","CAN J BOT","Can.

The highest plant regrowth after cryopreservation (66%) was achieved when shoot tips were pre-cultured in 0.3 M sucrose for 17 h followed by 0.5 M sucrose for 4 h, incubated in an osmo-protectant solution (17.5% [v/v] glycerol and 17.5% [w/v] sucrose) for 20 min, exposed to vitrification solution A3 (37.5% [v/v] glycerol plus 15% [v/v] dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) plus 15% [v/v] ethylene glycol (EG) plus 22.5% [w/v] sucrose) on ice for 40 min, and unloaded in 0.8 M sucrose solution for 30 min. Healthy plants were developed from cryopreserved shoot tips and propagated in vitro using nodal segments. Plants derived from in vitro culture and from cryopreserved tissues were successfully rooted and acclimated in a greenhouse with 100% survival rate. Acclimatized plants were reintroduced in a naturalized propagation area at the Conservation Nursery at Fort Rodd Hill, Canada. Twenty of 94 reintroduced plants (21%) survived the transit from lab to field and some had started to flower. This is the first report for cryopreservation of C. levisecta, an important step in conserving and re-introducing this critically imperiled species in nature.","[Salama, Ahmed; Popova, Elena; Jones, Maxwell P.; Shukla, Mukund R.; Saxena, Praveen K.] Univ Guelph, Gosling Res Inst Plant Preservat, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Popova, Elena] Global Crop Divers Trust, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Fisk, Nathan S.] Pk Canada Govt Canada, 603 Ft Rodd Hill Rd, Victoria, BC V9C 2W8, Canada","University of Guelph","Saxena, PK (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Gosling Res Inst Plant Preservat, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.","psaxena@uoguelph.ca","Popova, Elena/N-6408-2019","Popova, Elena/0000-0002-4655-6974","Gosling Foundation, Guelph, Canada","Gosling Foundation, Guelph, Canada","This research was supported by grants from the Gosling Foundation, Guelph, Canada, to the Gosling Research Institute for Plant Preservation (GRIPP).",NA,"46","27","27","0","20","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","1054-5476","1475-2689","","IN VITRO CELL DEV-PL","In Vitro Cell.

By placing their biology and geography in a phylogenetic context, we may gain a broader knowledge of the series of historical events that have led to present species distributions. In addition to the North American annuals, a second radiation of annual Castilleja species is in Andean Peru and central Chile. Phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast and nuclear DNA regions revealed a complex history for the origin and diversification of annual Castilleja species in South America. In addition to at least three independent long-distance dispersal events from North America, allopolyploidy has played a significant role in this disjunct radiation. Only C. ottenuata occurs in both California and South America, and these results support its recent arrival to central Chile. Two Peruvian species are inferred to be allopolyploids; hybridization between annual lineages derived from independent long-distance dispersal events from North America gave rise to C. profunda, and hybridization between South American annual and perennial species gave rise to C. cerroana. The relative importance these events are discussed with reference to the observed morphological, ecological, and distributional patterns.","[Tank, David C.] Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Dept Forest Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Tank, David C.] Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Stillinger Herbarium, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Tank, David C.; Olmstead, Richard G.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Tank, David C.; Olmstead, Richard G.] Univ Washington, Burke Museum Nat Hist, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Idaho; University of Idaho; Idaho; University of Idaho; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Tank, DC (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Dept Forest Resources, POB 441133, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.","dtank@uidaho.edu","","","University of Washington Department of Botany; American Society of Plant Taxonomists; Botanical Society of America; Society of Systematic Biologists; University of Washington Chapter; University of Washington Department of Botany to D.C.T.; SF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement [DEB-0412653]; NSF [DEB-0090313]","University of Washington Department of Botany(University of Washington); American Society of Plant Taxonomists; Botanical Society of America; Society of Systematic Biologists; University of Washington Chapter(University of Washington); University of Washington Department of Botany to D.C.T.(University of Washington); SF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","The authors thank J.

The antioxidant activity in each extract was evaluated using three in vitro models: scavenging of free radicals with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), and reducing power by the phosphomolybdenum assay. Both, antioxidant activity and phytochemicals content were influenced significantly (P < 0.05) by the source of the plant material and the organ. Cultivated plants had the highest content of phenolic compounds (37.95 mg gallic acid equiv. g(-1) dry weight, P < 0.05) and the strongest antioxidant activity. Total phenolic compounds content correlated significantly with the antioxidant activity for all studied plant material and organs (P < 0.05). TLC profile using DPPH as a detection reagent indicated that the phenylethanoids verbascoside and isoverbascoside are the main contributors to the free-radical scavenging of C. tenuiflora. Cultivated plants of C. tenuiflora are an alternative source of natural antioxidants to wild growing plants. The antioxidant properties of C. tenuiflora may be associated with its traditional use to treat conditions consistent with radical-related diseases (e.g. inflammation, tumors).","[Lopez-Laredo, Alma R.; Adriana Gomez-Aguirre, Yenny; Medina-Perez, Virginia; Salcedo-Morales, Guadalupe; Sepulveda-Jimenez, Gabriela; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela] Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Biotecnol, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot, Yautepec 62730, Morelos, Mexico","Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico","Trejo-Tapia, G (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Biotecnol, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot, POB 24, Yautepec 62730, Morelos, Mexico.","gttapia@ipn.mx","Sepúlveda-Jiménez, Gabriela/ABD-6150-2020; Gómez, Yenny/O-2796-2017; Gomez, Yenny/H-8200-2017; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela/M-3725-2013","Sepúlveda-Jiménez, Gabriela/0000-0003-0033-9306; Gomez, Yenny/0000-0002-7244-3383; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela/0000-0002-7479-9332","Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del Instituto Politecnico Nacional (SIP-IPN) [20110153, 20120745]; Fondo Mixto de Fomento a la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONACYT-Gobierno del Estado de Morelos [MOR-2007-C01-79409]; CONACyT","Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del Instituto Politecnico Nacional (SIP-IPN); Fondo Mixto de Fomento a la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONACYT-Gobierno del Estado de Morelos; CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))","This research was financed by the Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del Instituto Politecnico Nacional (SIP-IPN, Grants 20110153 and 20120745) and Fondo Mixto de Fomento a la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONACYT-Gobierno del Estado de Morelos (MOR-2007-C01-79409).

These polyploid species (including C. aspera, C. integrifolia, and C. tenuiflora) are the most troublesome taxonomically and substantiate our contention that polyploidy and hybridization are largely responsible for the complex morphological variation found in Castilleja. It is estimated that only 25% of Mexican elements of Castilleja (excluding C. affinis and C. subinclusa) exhibit polyploidy, in contrast to more than 50% polyploidy in western North American representatives. The unusual chromosome number of n = 10 in the closely related C. gracilis and C. tenuifolia is postulated to be an aneuploid reduction from an n = 12 progenitor. The role of chromosome number, especially polyploidy, in the evolution of Castilleja and its taxonomic significance is indicated for individual species.","UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,JEPSON HERBARIUM,BERKELEY,CA 94720","University of California System; University of California Berkeley","CHUANG, TI (corresponding author), ILLINOIS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,NORMAL,IL 61761, USA.","","","","","","",NA,"39","7","8","0","3","MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN","ST LOUIS","2345 TOWER GROVE AVENUE, ST LOUIS, MO 63110","0026-6493","","","ANN MO BOT GARD","Ann.

Therefore, it is surprising that little is known about whether ploidy variation, both within and among species, influences spatial patterns of interspecific hybridization. The role that polyploidy plays in structuring gene flow patterns between three co-occurring Indian paintbrush (Castilleja) species is investigated. Methods: Reciprocal hand pollinations were performed in populations where the three species co-occur with and without variable plants (previous data tested the ancestral hybrid history of these variable plants). I measured fruit set, seed production, seed germination, and the DNA content of parent plants and 26 synthesized F-1 hybrids. Data were combined with pollinator fidelity data to estimate the contribution of individual barriers to reproductive isolation. Key results: Interspecific gene flow could occur in all directions, but barriers were weaker for conspecific vs. heterospecific crosses. Species were nearly fixed for different ploidy levels, but some deviations occurred, primarily in populations with variable plants. Interspecific gene flow could occur across ploidy levels, but it was more likely when species had the same number of chromosomes or when resulting F-1 hybrids had even numbers of chromosomes. Postzygotic reproductive barriers were generally weaker than pollinator fidelity. Conclusions: Polyploidy likely plays a large role in shaping contemporary and historical patterns of gene flow among these species. This study suggests that differences in chromosome numbers among closely related, compatible species might help structure spatial patterns of hybridization.","Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","Michigan Technological University","Hersch-Green, EI (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.","eherschg@mtu.edu","","Hersch-Green, Erika/0000-0003-3887-0768","National Institutes of Health IGERT training fellowship; National Science Foundation graduate predoctoral fellowship; National Science Foundation dissertation improvement grant [DEB-0412350]","National Institutes of Health IGERT training fellowship; National Science Foundation graduate predoctoral fellowship; National Science Foundation dissertation improvement grant(National Science Foundation (NSF))","I thank L.

In this work, we propose binary mixtures using a leader compound to found pharmacodynamic interactions in inhibition of the NF-kappa B/AP-1 pathway using RAW-Blue (TM) cells. Eight compounds were isolated from Castilleja tenuiflora, four were new furofuran-type lignans for the species magnolin, eudesmin, sesamin, and kobusin. Magnolin (60.97%) was the most effective lignan inhibiting the NF-kappa B/AP-1 pathway, followed by eudesmin (56.82%), tenuifloroside (52.91%), sesamin (52.63%), and kobusin (45.45%).

We examined its putative allopolyploid origin with molecular, morphological, and cytological analyses. In analyses of restriction site mutations of the chloroplast genome, we found that none of the seventeen species of Castilleja examined was characterized by a unique haplotype or set of haplotypes. Rather, geographically isolated species are polymorphic for similar arrays of haplotypes. Moreover, we found no nuclear ribosomal DNA repeat types that characterized species; polymorphisms in nuclear ribosomal DNA repeats were distributed both among individuals and among repeat units of single individuals. Morphometric analyses revealed morphological discontinuities among species, including C. crista-galli, but cladistic analyses of morphological characters failed to reveal synapomorphies for most taxa. Thus, morphological and molecular data were uninformative regarding the hybrid origin of C. crista-galli. Results of cytological analyses do not support allopolyploid origin. We detected diploid and tetraploid populations of C, crista-galli, previously known as just an octoploid. We retain the specific status of C. crista-galli under a morphological species concept. We also suggest that the species of Castilleja included in this study may have radiated recently and rapidly, maintaining ancestral polymorphism.","Harvard Univ Hebaria, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Montana State Univ, Dept Biol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Harvard University; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman","Mathews, S (corresponding author), Harvard Univ Hebaria, 22 Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","","Lavin, Martin F/F-5961-2014; Mathews, Sarah/A-6513-2015","Lavin, Matt/0000-0003-4205-1802","","","",NA,"69","8","9","0","7","AMER SOC PLANT TAXONOMISTS","LARAMIE","UNIV WYOMING, DEPT BOTANY 3165, 1000 E UNIVERSITY AVE, LARAMIE, WY 82071 USA","0363-6445","","","SYST BOT","Syst.

However, pollinators were not deterred from visiting Castilleja parasitizing alkaloid-containing hosts. To determine if alkaloids are present in all tissues of plants parasitizing lupins, we analyzed floral tissue as well as leaves of both Castilleja species. Leaves, bracts, calices, corollas, gynoecium and nectar of both Castilleja species were examined for quinolizidine alkaloid presence using a Dragendorff reagent, and alkaloids were identified in vegetative tissue and nectar by capillary GLC and GLC-MS. Lupanine and alpha-isolupanine were the principal alkaloids in C. indivisa parasitizing L. texensis, while principal alkaloids of C. miniata parasitizing L. argenteus were 5,6-iso-dehydrolupanine, alpha-isolupanine, thermopsine, and 17-oxolupanine. Except for 17-oxolupanine, which was probably synthesized by biotransformation in the parasite, all other alkaloids correspond to those present in the host plants. Alkaloids were present in the leaves of both Castilleja species, and in the bracts, calices and gynoecium of some plants, but never in the corollas. Alkaloids from L. texensis and L. argenteus were not detected in nectar of either Castelleja species. The presence of alkaloids leaves and outer floral tissue of both Castilleja species, but not nectar. may explain why alkaloid uptake and storage affected herbivores but not pollinators.

Hemiparasites are capable of connecting to their hosts' root or stem vascular systems through haustoria establishing a flow of water and nutrients between host and parasite. These parasitic associations have an important influence on biodiversity, consequently shaping plant communities through a reduction in growth and alteration of the competitive ability of parasitized hosts. Castilleja fissifolia L.f. (Orobanchaceae), the genus' type species, is an abundant erect herb that inhabits the high tropical Andes and is commonly found in close spatial association with other plant species. Since many other species of the genus Castilleja have been described as hemiparasites, we sought to determine if C. fissifolia establishes parasitic relationships in the Venezuelan high Andes. And if so, to study its host range and facultative/obligate relations. Ten soil blocks which included C. fissifolia individuals were excavated from each of three sites in Piedras Blancas Paramo (PBP, 4250 m), taken to the laboratory and thoroughly examined to identify the presence of C. fissifolia-host interfaces. Instances in which one or more haustoria were found anchored to the roots of a potential host were recorded. C fissifolia acts as a non-specific hemiparasite of at least 44 plant species in PBP, including 25 eudicots, 18 monocots, and 1 pteridophyte, belonging to 16 plant families.

We conducted common garden experiments with golden paintbrush (Castilleja levisecta), an endangered species from the Pacific Northwest, U.S.A., in order to test hypotheses about reintroduction performance and to provide management recommendations. Ten common gardens, each composed of C. levisecta individuals grown from seed from six of the remaining populations, were planted into field conditions and monitored during two growing seasons. Plant community characteristics were important predictors of observed variation in C. levisecta performance. Exotic species-cover at common garden sites was associated with a reduction in performance of first-year C. levisecta transplants, while survival to the second growing season increased with increasing similarity in plant functional groups between source and common garden sites. Although measures of genetic diversity, population size, and geographic distance are often used to make conservation decisions during species recovery, here they were poor predictors of C. levisecta performance and establishment.

Currently restricted to two island populations off British Columbia and nine populations (eight on islands) in Washington, C. levisecta is a rare species threatened with extinction. Allozymes were used to describe genetic diversity and structure in these eleven populations. Despite its threatened status and small geographic range, exceptionally high levels of genetic diversity are maintained within C. levisecta. All sixteen of the loci resolved were polymorphic within the species (P-s=100%), while the mean percentage of loci polymorphic within populations (P-p) was 65.7%. The mean number of alleles per polymorphic locus (AP(s)) was 2.94 within the species and averaged 2.38 within populations (AP(p)). Genetic diversity (H-es) was 0.285 for the species, whereas mean population genetic diversity (H-ep) was 0.213. Smaller populations had, on average, fewer observed alleles and less genetic diversity. A significant negative correlation (r = 0.72) was found between genetic identity and geographic distance, indicating reduced gene flow between distant populations. The most geographically isolated population was one of the larger populations, one of the most genetically diverse and the most genetically divergent. A wide range of pairwise population genetic identities (I = 0.771 - 0.992) was found, indicating considerable genetic divergence between some populations. Overall, 19% of the total genetic diversity was distributed among populations. Results of this survey indicate that genetic augmentation of existing populations is unnecessary. The high allelic diversity found for the species and within its populations holds promise for conservation and restoration efforts to save this rare and threatened plant species.","Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Washington State Dept Nat Resources, Washington Nat Heritage Program, Olympia, WA 98504 USA; Univ Georgia, Dept Genet, Athens, GA 30602 USA","University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia","Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.","godt@plantbio.uga.edu","","","","","",NA,"60","43","51","0","16","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1566-0621","1572-9737","","CONSERV GENET","Conserv.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis of two chloroplast (rps16 and trnL/F) and two nuclear ribosomal (internal and external transcribed spacers) DNA regions support the monophyly of subtribe Castillejinae (Orobanchaceae). A well-supported phylogeny of the six genera (Castilleja [similar to 180 spp.], Clevelandia [1 sp.], Cordylanthus [18 spp.], Ophiocephalus [1 sp.], Orthocarpus [9 spp.], and Triphysaria [5 spp]) comprising the subtribe is presented, and morphological synapomorphies are identified for the major lineages recovered. Orthocarpus and Triphysaria are both monophyletic; Cordylanthus is biphyletic. Clevelandia and Ophiocephalus are derived from within Castilleja. The perennial Castilleja clade (similar to 160 spp.) is derived from a grade of annual taxa including Castilleja sect. Oncorhynchus (16 spp.), Cordylanthus, Orthocarpus, and Triphysaria. This suggests that the perennial habit evolved a single time from an annual ancestral lineage that persisted throughout the diversification of Castillejinae, contrary to classical interpretations of life history evolution in plants. Given the prevalence of polyploidy among perennial Castilleja species, perenniality may have played an important role in the origin and establishment of polyploidy in Castilleja.","[Tank, David C.; Olmstead, Richard G.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Olmstead, Richard G.] Univ Washington, Burke Museum Nat Hist, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Tank, DC (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Div Bot, Peabody Museum Nat Hist, POB 208118, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.","david.tank@yale.edu","","","","","",NA,"104","94","107","1","41","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0002-9122","1537-2197","","AM J BOT","Am.

Explanations offered to explain patterns of hybridization that vary by population have usually focused on genetic or environmental factors. Instead, we examined whether different community contexts might change pollinator preference and constancy and thus influence the likelihood of hybridization among three Indian paintbrush species (Castilleja miniata, C. rhexifolia, and C. sulphurea). To determine whether visitation was context-dependent, we observed pollinator behavior in experimental arrays (constructed using flowering stems of the three Indian paintbrush species) in different contexts. Contexts were defined by which Castilleja species occurred in the immediate neighborhood of the arrays. Specifically, we asked, does visitation to particular species in the arrays depend on context? In general, each Castilleja species was preferred when it matched the surrounding community context, as is predicted by optimal foraging theory. More interestingly, pollinator constancy was weakened in the hybrid context (an area where the three species co-occurred with morphologically intermediate plants), which is likely to increase pollen flow among the species. Reduced pollinator constancy in hybrid zones could set up a positive feedback loop in which more flower diversity is created through hybridization, decreasing pollinator constancy, and leading to more hybridization. This self-reinforcing mechanism could lead to hybridization hot spots and to a patchy distribution of hybrid populations. We expect that this mechanism may be important in other animal-pollinated plant hybrid zones.","Univ Oregon, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Eugene, OR 97405 USA","University of Oregon","Hersch, EI (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Eugene, OR 97405 USA.","ehersch@uoregon.edu","Roy, Barbara (â€˜Bitty/HZJ-1032-2023","Hersch-Green, Erika/0000-0003-3887-0768","","","",NA,"93","58","69","1","43","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0014-3820","1558-5646","","EVOLUTION","Evolution","JAN","2007","61","1",NA,"","","","111","124","","10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00009.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00009.x","","","14","Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity","137HZ","17300431","Bronze",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000244285000010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

These hemiparasitic plants are characterized by haustoria organs that develop on the roots of the parasite and function in host attachment, invasion, and uptake of nutrients and water from the host plant. The hosts of C tenuiflora are unknown, and the characteristics of its haustoria have not been reported. We evaluated the plant density, size, phenological stage, number of haustoria, and potential hosts in a field population of C. tenuiflora. Cross-and longitudinal sections of haustoria were stained with safranin O and fast green, and the presence of starch and tannins was determined histochemically. The density of C. tenuiflora in the field population was 8 +/- 13 plants/m(2) and there were plants at the vegetative, floral, and senescent stages. The number (1-6) and size (0.5-2.5 mm) of haustoria varied with plant size. In the field, individuals of C. tenuiflora were growing near plants belonging to families Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Pinaceae and Poaceae. The haustoria were globular, bore hairs, and consisted of dermal, ground, vascular, and young endophyte. Starch was stored in the ground tissue and condensed tannins were present in the young endophyte. The haustoria also contained sclerotic tissue (fibers and sclereids), alternate-pit-type vessel elements, and scalariform tracheids. Our findings provide new information on components of haustoria that might be related to the efficiency of water transport and mechanical support. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Less is known about how these processes interact at early stages of speciation. Here, we compared population-level differentiation in floral phenotype and genetic sequence variation among recently diverged Castilleja to explore patterns of diversification under different scenarios of reproductive isolation. Methods Using target enrichment enabled by the Angiosperms353 probe set, we assessed genetic distance among 50 populations of four Castilleja species. We investigated whether patterns of genetic divergence are explained by floral trait variation or geographic distance in two focal groups: the widespread C. sessiliflora and the more restricted C. purpurea species complex. Results We document that C. sessiliflora and the C. purpurea complex are characterized by high diversity in floral color across varying geographic scales. Despite phenotypic divergence, groups were not well supported in phylogenetic analyses, and little genetic differentiation was found across targeted Angiosperms353 loci. Nonetheless, a principal coordinate analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed differentiation within C. sessiliflora across floral morphs and geography and less differentiation among species of the C. purpurea complex. Conclusions Patterns of genetic distance in C. sessiliflora suggest species cohesion maintained over long distances despite variation in floral traits. In the C. purpurea complex, divergence in floral color across narrow geographic clines may be driven by recent selection on floral color. These contrasting patterns of floral and genetic differentiation reveal that divergence can arise via multiple eco-evolutionary paths.","[Wenzell, Katherine E.; Wickett, Norman J.; Fant, Jeremie B.; Skogen, Krissa A.] Northwestern Univ, Program Plant Biol & Conservat, OT Hogan Hall,Room 6-140B,2205 Tech Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Wenzell, Katherine E.; McDonnell, Angela J.; Wickett, Norman J.; Fant, Jeremie B.; Skogen, Krissa A.] Chicago Bot Garden, Negaunee Inst Plant Conservat Sci & Act, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA; [Wenzell, Katherine E.] John Innes Ctr, Norwich Res Pk,Colney Lane, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England","Northwestern University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); John Innes Center","Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Program Plant Biol & Conservat, OT Hogan Hall,Room 6-140B,2205 Tech Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), Chicago Bot Garden, Negaunee Inst Plant Conservat Sci & Act, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA.;Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), John Innes Ctr, Norwich Res Pk,Colney Lane, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England.","kwenzell@u.northwestern.edu","Skogen, Krissa/AAA-3370-2022; Wickett, Norman/AAV-8136-2021; McDonnell, Angela/T-3971-2019","Skogen, Krissa/0000-0002-7868-9632; Wickett, Norman/0000-0003-0944-1956; McDonnell, Angela/0000-0002-2549-9253; Wenzell, Katherine/0000-0002-1635-5485; Fant, Jeremie/0000-0001-9276-1111","Botanical Society of America; American Society of Plant Taxonomists; American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant; Friends of Nachusa Grasslands; Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; NSF [DGE-1842165, DBI-461007, DBI-1757800, DEB-1752785]; Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation and Action at the Chicago Botanic Garden","Botanical Society of America; American Society of Plant Taxonomists; American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant; Friends of Nachusa Grasslands; Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation and Action at the Chicago Botanic Garden","The authors thank the members of the Skogen--Fant lab group and two anonymous reviewers for feedback on previous versions of this manuscript.

The haustorium is the characteristic structure of hemiparasitic plants and its anatomy varies depending several factors such as host species, position on the root and environment. Question: What is the structure and anatomy of haustoria builded in field interaction? Based on C, N and chlorophyll contents, is C. tenuiflora a facultative hemiparasite of B. conferta? Species studied: Castilleja tenuiflora Benth. and Baccharis conferta Kunth. Study site and dates: Plant materials were collected in the Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl National Park (N 19 degrees 0.5' 9.6 '', W 98 degrees 40' 24.2 '', 3,480 m.a.s.l.), State of Mexico, Mexico, in December 2013. Methods: Individuals of B. conferta and C. tenuiflora growing independently or in hemiparasite interactions were collected and samples were processed for anatomical and histochemical characterization, determination of C, N and chlorophyll. Results: Haustoria were globular and located mainly in the lateral roots of B. conferta. Anatomy of haustorium shows the characteristic structures: exophyte and endophyte. Haustorial tissues storage starch, tannins and essential oils while in the B. conferta roots also calcium oxalate crystals were found. C levels were significantly influenced by hemiparasitic interaction. This is the first study that characterizes a hemiparasitic interaction in the field and specifically between C. tenuiflora and B. conferta. Conclusions: Haustoria builded in interaction with B. conferta show the characteristic structure and anatomy. Hemiparasitic relationship represents for C. tenuiflora a source of C and other compounds such as essential oils.","[Montes-Hernandez, Edith; Bermudez-Torres, Kalina; Luis Trejo-Espino, Jose; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot, Dept Biotecnol, Yautepec, Morelos, Mexico; [Sandoval-Zapotitla, Estela] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Jardin Bot, Lab Anat Vegetal, Coyoacan, Ciudad De Mexic, Mexico; [Montes-Hernandez, Edith] Tecnol Estudios Super Ixtapaluca, Dept Ingn Ambiental, Ixtapaluca, Estado De Mexic, Mexico","Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","Trejo-Tapia, G (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot, Dept Biotecnol, Yautepec, Morelos, Mexico.","gttapia@ipn.mx","Trejo-Espino, JoseLuis/AAK-4854-2021; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela/M-3725-2013","Bermudez Torres, Kalina/0000-0002-7267-7657","Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del Instituto Politecnico Nacional [1623-20150389]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT-Mexico) [CB-2013-01-220007]; CONACyT","Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del Instituto Politecnico Nacional; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT-Mexico)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))","This research was financed by the Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del Instituto Politecnico Nacional (grants 1623-20150389) and by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT-Mexico) (Grant CB-2013-01-220007).

(Orobanchaceae) is a medicinal plant that synthetizes terpenes and phenolic compounds of therapeutic value. This study aimed to analyze the effect of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) at different concentrations on growth and content of total phenolic compounds (TPC) in C. tenuiflora in vitro plants. Changes in the concentration of secondary metabolites and gene expression patterns of four enzymes (DXS, G10H, PAL, and CHS) involved in metabolite biosynthesis were carried out under MeJA elicitation. MeJA did not decrease growth and 100 mu M MeJA caused greater production of TPC. The increase in TPC was accompanied by an increase in PAL activity and in H2O2 content. MeJA elicitation had a greater effect on phenolic compounds than on iridoids, increasing the contents of verbascoside and aucubin to 82.1 +/- 0.8 mg g(-1) dry matter and 14.6 +/- 0.2 mg g(-1) dry matter, respectively. The highest accumulation of aucubin occurred after short exposure to the elicitor. MeJA treatment up-regulated the expression of metabolite biosynthesis related genes Cte-PAL1, Cte-CHS1, Cte-DXS1, and Cte-G10H when compared to control plants.

It is highly valued for its medicinal properties, which have been attributed to aucubin-like iridoids. In the present study, we developed an efficient protocol for in vitro shoot proliferation and ex vitro rooting of C. tenuiflora. Using a colorimetric method, we determined total iridoid contents of various different tissues of propagated plants. The shoots were induced from nodal explants cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) (1962) medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) (0 and 0.5 mu M) and different concentrations of thidiazuron (TDZ), 6-benzyladenine (BA), or kinetin (KIN) (0-20 mu M). Of the cytokinins tested, KIN was more effective for shoot induction than TDZ or BA, and the highest shoot proliferation rate was achieved with 5 mu M KIN (4 shoots per explant). Plantlets were rooted on MS medium, nutrient solution, or potting mix, alone or in combination with auxins. The best responses (100% rooting efficiency) were obtained by dipping shoots in half-strength MS medium containing 7.5 mu M IBA before transfer to potting mix. On average, each shoot formed 9 roots of 39.3 +/- 3.8 mm in length after 21 days. These roots appeared to be more functional than those that developed in nutrient solution, and were associated with a high survival rate (95%) during acclimatization and cultivation in a greenhouse, where flowering occurred after 4 months. Propagated plants accumulated iridoids, thus representing a potential source of pharmacologically useful compounds.","[Martinez-Bonfil, Blanca P.; Salcedo-Morales, Guadalupe; Lopez-Laredo, Alma R.; Ventura-Zapata, Elsa; Evangelista-Lozano, Silvia; Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela] Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Biotecnol, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot, Yautepec 62730, Mor, Mexico","Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico","Trejo-Tapia, G (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Biotecnol, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot, POB 24, Yautepec 62730, Mor, Mexico.","gttapia@ipn.mx","Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela/M-3725-2013","Trejo-Tapia, Gabriela/0000-0002-7479-9332","Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del IPN-Mexico (SIP-IPN) [20100308]; Fondo Mixto de Fomento a la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONACYT-Gobierno del Estado de Morelos [MOR-2007-C01-79409]","Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del IPN-Mexico (SIP-IPN); Fondo Mixto de Fomento a la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONACYT-Gobierno del Estado de Morelos","This work was supported by the Secretaria de Investigacion y Posgrado del IPN-Mexico (SIP-IPN Grant 20100308) and by Fondo Mixto de Fomento a la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONACYT-Gobierno del Estado de Morelos (Grant MOR-2007-C01-79409).

We evaluated the effects of six different immersion cycles in a temporary immersion bioreactor on C. tenuiflora shoot growth, proliferation rate, phenolics content, flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity. We also evaluated the regeneration capacity of the shoots. The highest proliferation rate (nine shoots per explant) was obtained using an immersion cycle of 5 min every 12 h, and the longest shoots (38.8 +/- 1.9 mm) were obtained using an immersion cycle of 5 min every 24 h. Shoots obtained from immersion cycles of 30 min every 24 h or 5 min every 24 h showed 100% rooting efficiency. Shoots obtained from immersion cycles of 30 min every 3 h or 30 min every 12 h accumulated H2O2, developed abnormal stomata, and showed symptoms of hyperhydricity. These characteristics were associated with a low survival rate (16-80%) when the plants were transferred to potting mix. The shoots from an immersion cycle of 30 min every 24 h showed the highest total phenolics content, which coincided with the highest antioxidant activity in the 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) free-radical scavenging assay (161.74 +/- 10.06 mu mol Trolox/g dry weight (DW)).

Thus, availability of N-fixing hosts may affect parasite's WUE and in turn impact the surrounding plant community. Here, I investigate how the availability of an N-fixing host affects the root hemiparasite, Castilleja applegatei, and examines host-mediated effects on community structure and soil moisture. I surveyed plant diversity and percent cover and measured soil moisture in 120 1 x 1 m plots within Sagehen Experimental Forest, CA. Fifty percent of the plots included C. applegatei. In a subset of plots, I measured leaf N, C/N, delta C-13, and delta N-15 in C. applegatei and in one N-fixer (Ceanothus prostratus) and two non-N-fixing plants (Artemisia tridentata and Wyethia mollis). In C. applegatei availability of N-fixing hosts corresponded to a significant increase in leaf %N, a distinct delta N-15 signature, and an increase in delta C-13 (which typically signifies an increased WUE). The presence of parasites was associated with a marginally significant decrease in WUE in N-fixing neighbors, but had no effect on the two non-N-fixing species. The presence of parasites did not impact diversity, percent cover, or soil moisture. These results broadly support the N-parasitism hypothesis and indicate that host type can affect parasite's physiology and therefore have the potential to mediate parasite's effects in the community; however, community-level impacts were not found here.","[Haynes, Audrey F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","University of California System; University of California Berkeley","Haynes, AF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.","audreyhaynes@berkeley.edu","","Haynes, Audrey/0000-0002-1764-2101","Department of Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley","Department of Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley","This research was funded through the Summer Research Award from the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley.",NA,"75","2","2","1","12","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1385-0237","1573-5052","","PLANT ECOL","Plant Ecol.","FEB","2022","223","2",NA,"","","","213","228","","10.1007/s11258-021-01200-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-021-01200-x","","NOV 2021","16","Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry","YK7PX",NA,"hybrid",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000716257400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

(Indian paintbrush; Scrophulariaceae) and Orthocarpus tolmiei H. & A. (Tolmie owl clover; Scrophulariaceae), and their Artemisia tridentata L. (big sagebrush; Asteraceae) hosts. Photosynthetic rates differed greatly between years; rates in 1995 were more than double those in 1994, likely due to more precipitation and less water stress during 1995. Despite this difference in precipitation, photosynthetic rates for C, linariifolia were not different from those of their hosts for either year. However, carbon isotope ratios of C. linariifolia and O. tolmiei were up to 3 parts per thousand more negative than those of their A. tridentata hosts. Using measured delta(13)C ratios in conjunction with delta(13)C ratios predicted from gas-exchange measurements, we calculated that C. linariifolia derived, on average, 40% of its leaf carbon heterotrophically. Contrary to current suggestions that high photosynthetic rates of hemiparasites are an indication of reduced heterotrophy, C. linariifolia exhibited photosynthetic rates similar to autotrophic plants and used a substantial amount of host-derived carbon. Moreover, this evidence shows that manipulation of a heterotrophic carbon supply transcends obligate hemiparasites to include those plants whose parasitism is facultative.","","","Ducharme, LA (corresponding author), UNIV UTAH,DEPT BIOL,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84112, USA.","","Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010","","","","",NA,"26","11","13","1","9","BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIV","PROVO","290 LIFE SCIENCE MUSEUM, PROVO, UT 84602","0017-3614","","","GREAT BASIN NAT","Gt.

Although it was a major sequestered iridoid, catalpol was a minor constituent in both host plants. The macfadienoside-catalpol ratio in the butterflies from this population was highly variable, and there appeared to be both sex and individual variation in host plant and/or iridoid glucoside utilization by E. anicia.

We use the second derivative of lambda with respect to the demographic parameters to explore this type of responses in a population of a root hemiparasite (Castilleja tenuiflora). For plants growing with and without hosts, population transition matrices were built for the 2016-2018 period, and sensitivities and elasticities together with pure derivatives of the Hessian matrix were calculated, together with the second derivatives to survival and fecundity. We transformed the Hessian matrix to a logarithmic scale to avoid values with no biological meaning. Germination showed high sensitivity values, while permanence of individuals with dry aerial tissue that re-sprout had the highest elasticity. Negative values on the second derivative and on the logarithmic representation were obtained for germination with and without hosts in both years. Survival and fecundity have a similar behaviour in both conditions and periods, with negative values for survival for the first category and no negative values for fecundity. High negative values of the second derivative of the transition from seed to seedling indicate an evolutionary stable strategy and imply seeds are important to the permanence of C. tenuiflora population. A stochastic analysis of the second derivative of the transition from seed to seedling was performed with a Gamma distribution analysis, and showed negative values in all cases, corroborating this result.","[Granados-Hernandez, Luisa A.; Pisanty, Irene] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Raventos, Jose] Univ Alicante, Dept Ecol, Alicante, Spain; [Ezcurra, Exequiel] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA USA","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universitat d'Alacant; University of California System; University of California Riverside","Pisanty, I (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.","ipisanty@ciencias.unam.mx","","Granados-Hernandez, Luisa A./0000-0002-7204-9327","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (Conacyt) [432340]; Programa de Apoyo a Estudiantes de Posgrado (PAEP/UNAM)","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (Conacyt)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Programa de Apoyo a Estudiantes de Posgrado (PAEP/UNAM)","Luisa A.

The encapsulation of microstakes is an option to propagate and prolong the storage of this plant. Therefore, the objective of this study was to establish a method for the encapsulation and conservation of C. tenuiflora microstakes that does not affect the content of the compounds of interest of this plant. Methods: Capsules were elaborated with sodium alginate in complex with calcium chloride dihydrate as matrix and tissue microstakes from seedlings grown in vitro. Different concentrations and polymerization times were tested, as well as different storage times and temperature, for later analysis of the major metabolites of the methanolic extracts by chromatography (HPLC) of the resulting plants. Key results: The combination for the production of capsules with microstakes is 3% sodium alginate and calcium chloride dihydrate at 50 mM, with 25 minutes of polymerization. The seedlings derived from synthetic seeds and stored for 100 days presented the same compounds as the donor plants. Conclusions: The encapsulation of C. tenuiflora microstakes with sodium alginate and calcium chloride dihydrate allows the storage of plant material and the main compounds are maintained. Hence, this method for the encapsulation and conservation of microstakes is an alternative to maintain the genotype of elite plants and counteract the illegal collection of wild plants.","[Leon-Romero, Yatzil; Trejo-Espino, Jose Luis; Salcedo-Morale, Guadalupe; Trejo-Tapi, Gabriela; Lozano, Silvia Evangelista] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot CEPROBI IPN, Carretera Yautepec Jojutla Km 6,Calle CEPROBI 8, Yautepec 62731, Morelos, Mexico","Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico","Trejo-Espino, JL; Lozano, SE (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot CEPROBI IPN, Carretera Yautepec Jojutla Km 6,Calle CEPROBI 8, Yautepec 62731, Morelos, Mexico.","jtrejo@ipn.mx; sevangel@ipn.mx","Trejo-Espino, JoseLuis/AAK-4854-2021",", SILVIA EVANGELISTA LOZANO/0000-0003-4650-0767; Trejo-Espino, Jose Luis/0000-0002-5885-360X","","","",NA,"42","0","0","1","6","INST ECOLOGIA AC","PATZCUARO","CENTRO REGIONAL DEL BAJIO, APARTADO POSTAL 386, PATZCUARO, MICHOACAN 61600, MEXICO","","2448-7589","","ACTA BOT MEX","Acta.

Total phenolic content (TPC), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity, antioxidant enzymes and specialized metabolite profiles, as well as the expression levels of eight genes involved in phenolic (Cte-TyrDC, Cte-GOT2, Cte-ADD, Cte-AO3, Cte-PAL1, Cte-CHS1) and terpene pathways (Cte-DXS1 and Cte-G10H) and their correlation with major metabolite (verbascoside and aucubin) concentrations were investigated. TPC content (three-fold) and PAL activity (11.5-fold) increased with mixed elicitation, as well as catalase and peroxidase activity (11.3-fold and 10.8-fold, respectively), compared to single elicitation. Phenylethanoid accumulation was greatest under mixed elicitation, followed by SA and H2O2. Lignan accumulation was differential, depending on the plant part and the elicitor. Flavonoids only appeared after mixed elicitation. The high concentration of verbascoside under mixed elicitation was related to a high gene expression. Single elicitation induced iridoid accumulation in specific parts (H2O2 in aerial parts and SA in roots), whereas under mixed elicitation, it accumulated in both parts. A high concentration of aucubin in the aerial part was related to a high expression level of genes of the terpene pathway Cte-DXS1 and Cte-G10H, and in the root with Cte-G10H, while Cte-DXS1 was downregulated in this tissue in all treatments.

We observed interactions of a Wisconsin isolate of C. r. ribicola with a conventional alternate host, an alternate host commonly infected by the East Asian form (C. r. pedicularis), and plants considered as nonhosts for our North Anerican form. Leaf samples collected at different times after inoculation with urediniospores were examined by light microscopy for penetration and infection or colonization. In the conventional alternate host Ribes nigrum, the fungus achieved an established infection through the formaton of haustoria, which were first visible 6 days after inoculation. The development of typical symptoms and signs followed within 7-9 days after inoculation. In Pedicularis resupinata, the host the host for the East Asian form, penetration and early stages of colonization were similar to those stages in R. nigrum. Infection hyphae branched sparingly in the intercellular spaces and occasionally reached as far as the upper epidermis between 5 and 16 days after inoculation but did not develop further. Colonization in the native P. canadensis and the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris, was similar to but slightly less extensive than in P. resupinata. Colonization in localized portions of leaves of some plants of Castilleja miniata was much more extensive than in the other nonhost species. In leaf sections taken 63 days after inoculation, intercellular space, in portions up to 2 mm long, was densely packed with profusely branched hyphae. Haustorial mother cells developed in all species, but no haustoria were formed in any species except R. nigrum. The results supported previous indications of a difference in pathogenicity between the two forms of C. ribicola. The surprising amount of colonization in C. miniata led to speculation about the possible presence of the East Asian form of the rust in the Pacific Northwest, or the possibility of adaptation of C. miniata as an alternate host for our North American form.","","","UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT PLANT PATHOL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA.","","","","","","",NA,"29","13","14","0","2","AMER PHYTOPATHOLOGICAL SOC","ST PAUL","3340 PILOT KNOB ROAD, ST PAUL, MN 55121 USA","0031-949X","1943-7684","","PHYTOPATHOLOGY","Phytopathology","MAY","1989","79","5",NA,"","","","539","547","","10.1094/Phyto-79-539","http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/Phyto-79-539","","","9","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","U6695",NA,"",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:A1989U669500008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Morphological evidence indicates that introgression from C. martinii var. martinii into C. chromosa occurred either on the diploid level or via backcrossing to the allopolyploid derivatives in the same mountains. Both diploid introgressants and allopolyploids derived from the same parents are postulated. The type specimen of C. ewanii falls within the diploid introgressants, and that name is placed in synonymy under C. chromosa. A new name, C. montigena, is proposed for the polyploids. C. montigena, which possesses recombinant morphological features of the 2 diploid parental species, had an additive nectar amino acid complement of the other 2 spp. when they were sampled in several regions at some distance from the San Bernardino mountains. Glutamic acid is lacking in C. chromosa and valine is lacking in C. martinii var. martinii, while both amino acids are present in the polyploids. In the San Bernardino Mountains, diploids of both parental species possess the additive amino acid complement, corroborating morphological evidence for limited gene exchange between the diploids in this area.","UNIV CALIF BERKELEY, JEPSON HERBARIUM, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA; UNIV CALIF DAVIS, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA; ILLINOIS STATE UNIV, NORMAL, IL 61761 USA","","","","","","","","",NA,"10","5","5","0","2","AMER SOC PLANT TAXONOMISTS","LARAMIE","UNIV WYOMING, DEPT BOTANY 3165, 1000 E UNIVERSITY AVE, LARAMIE, WY 82071 USA","0363-6445","1548-2324","","SYST BOT","Syst.

This study investigated larval preference, performance, and sequestration of iridoid glycosides in a population of E. anicia at Crescent Meadows, Colorado, USA. Although previous studies showed that other populations in Colorado use the host plant, Castilleja integra (Orobanchaceae), we found no evidence for E. anicia ovipositing or feeding on C. integra at Crescent Meadows. Though C. integra and another host plant, Penstemon glaber (Plantaginaceae), occur at Crescent Meadows, the primary host plant used was P. glaber. To determine why C. integra was not being used at the Crescent Meadows site, we first examined the host plant preference of naive larvae between P. glaber and C. integra. Then we assessed the growth and survivorship of larvae reared on each plant species. Finally, we quantified the iridoid glycoside concentrations of the two plant species and diapausing caterpillars reared on each host plant. Our results showed that E. anicia larvae prefer P. glaber. Also, larvae survive and grow better when reared on P. glaber than on C. integra. Castilleja integra was found to contain two primary iridoid glycosides, macfadienoside and catalpol, and larvae reared on this plant sequestered both compounds; whereas P. glaber contained only catalpol and larvae reared on this species sequestered catalpol. Thus, although larvae are able to use C. integra in the laboratory, the drivers behind the lack of use at the Crescent Meadows site remain unclear.","[Bradley, Lauren E.; Kelly, Caitlin A.; Bowers, M.

In this greenhouse study, I focused on pairs of hosts consisting of either two leguminous host individuals (Lupinus arboreus; Fabaceae), two non-nitrogen-fixing hosts (Eriophyllum stachaedifolium; Asteraceae), or one individual of each of these species. Castilleja growth and reproductive performance were greatly improved by the simultaneous attack of two distinct host species, even though Castilleja grown with two Lupinus hosts had significantly higher nitrogen content. Different combinations of host species also strongly affected the growth of aphid colonies feeding on the Castilleja used in this experiment. Across all treatments, the growth of aphid colonies was positively correlated with the nitrogen content of the parasitic plants, which, in turn depended on the combination of hosts attacked. Aphid colonies feeding on parasites attacking a mixture of host species grew more slowly than those on parasites attacking two Lupinus individuals. Therefore, simultaneous attack of a mixture of host species may lead to improved parasite performance in two ways-via a direct benefit on parasite growth and flowering as well as a possible indirect benefit because of the relatively poor performance of herbivores feeding on these parasites.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz","Univ Washington, Dept Zool, Box 351800, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","","","Marvier, Michelle/0000-0001-8360-9265","","","",NA,"56","47","56","2","22","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0012-9658","1939-9170","","ECOLOGY","Ecology","JUN","1998","79","4",NA,"","","","1272","1280","","","","","","9","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","ZQ282",NA,"",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000073841800012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Incongruence in delimitation schemes is a potential by-product of employing multiple methods on the same data, and little attention has been paid to its reconciliation. Instead, a particular scheme is prioritized, and/or molecular delimitations are coupled with additional, independent lines of evidence that mitigate incongruence. We advocate that incongruence within a line of evidence should be accounted for before comparing across lines of evidence that can themselves be incongruent. Additionally, it is not uncommon for empiricists working in nonmodel systems to be data-limited, generating some concern for the adequacy of available data to address the question of interest. With conservation and management decisions often hinging on the status of species, it seems prudent to understand the capabilities of approaches we use given the data we have. Here, we apply two molecular species delimitation approaches, spedeSTEM and BPP, to the Castilleja ambigua (Orobanchaceae) species complex, a relatively young plant lineage in western North America. Upon finding incongruence in our delimitation, we employed a post hoc simulation study to examine the power of these approaches to delimit species. Given the data we collected, we find that spedeSTEM lacks the power to delimit while BPP is capable, thus allowing us to address incongruence before proceeding in delimitation. We suggest post hoc simulation studies like this compliment empirical delimitation and serve as a means of exploring conflict within a line of evidence and dealing with it appropriately.","[Jacobs, Sarah J.; Kristofferson, Casey; Uribe-Convers, Simon; Latvis, Maribeth; Tank, David C.] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Jacobs, Sarah J.; Kristofferson, Casey; Uribe-Convers, Simon; Latvis, Maribeth; Tank, David C.] Univ Idaho, Stillinger Herbarium, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Jacobs, Sarah J.; Kristofferson, Casey; Uribe-Convers, Simon; Latvis, Maribeth; Tank, David C.] Univ Idaho, Inste Bioinformat & Evolutionary Studies IBEST, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Uribe-Convers, Simon] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Latvis, Maribeth] South Dakota State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management, Brookings, SD USA","Idaho; University of Idaho; Idaho; University of Idaho; Idaho; University of Idaho; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; South Dakota State University","Jacobs, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.","sarahjjacobs@gmail.com","Jacobs, Sarah/JRW-7265-2023; Uribe-Convers, Simon/I-1143-2013; Jacobs, Sarah/S-9703-2017","Jacobs, Sarah/0000-0002-3125-6266","NIH/NCRR [P20RR016454, P20RR16448]; NSF DEB [1253463, 1502061]; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1253463, 1502061] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NIH/NCRR(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NSF DEB(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","NIH/NCRR, Grant/Award Number: P20RR016454, P20RR16448; NSF DEB, Grant/Award Number: 1253463, 1502061",NA,"92","23","25","0","30","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0962-1083","1365-294X","","MOL ECOL","Mol.

We present a case study involving two such species: golden paintbrush (Castilleja levisecta) and Taylor's checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha taylori), both of which occur in lowland prairies in the Puget Sound region and are federally protected (threatened and endangered, respectively). These two species occupy some of the same sites, and golden paintbrush likely historically served as a larval food plant for Taylor's checkerspot. Managers working to recover these species have encountered a number of challenges and opportunities-recovery efforts for one species may have no effect, positive effects, or negative effects on the other. Furthermore, sometimes rapid recovery actions are necessary on shorter time scales than those at which research typically occurs, and must proceed in spite of significant knowledge gaps. Here we share how our growing understanding of the complex ecology of these species has given rise to large-scale management questions and conflicts, and outline the strategies we are using to navigate these challenges. Our approach has included convening periodic workshops with experts on both species; designing and implementing research studies to fill knowledge gaps about the two species' relationship; and identifying no regrets actions that can be taken to benefit one or both species with minimal risk in the face of uncertainty. While the details of this case study are highly specific, the lessons can be applied to other systems with interacting listed species.","[Dunwiddie, Peter W.; Fimbel, Cheryl] Ctr Nat Lands Management, Union Ave, Olympia, WA 98501 USA; [Dunwiddie, Peter W.; Haan, Nathan L.; Bakker, Jonathan D.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & ForestSci, Box 354115, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Linders, Mary] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, 600 Capitol Way N, Olympia, WA 98501 USA; [Thomas, Theodore B.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Washington Field Off, Lacey, WA 98503 USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife (WDFW); United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service","Dunwiddie, PW (corresponding author), Ctr Nat Lands Management, Union Ave, Olympia, WA 98501 USA.;Dunwiddie, PW (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & ForestSci, Box 354115, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","pdunwidd@uw.edu","Bakker, Jonathan/I-6960-2013; Dunwiddie, Peter/Q-7709-2016","Bakker, Jonathan/0000-0002-8973-2771; Dunwiddie, Peter/0000-0002-7254-0423; Haan, Nathan/0000-0003-1713-7911","US Fish and Wildlife Service; US Department of Defense through the Army Compatible Use Buffer program; Joint Base Lewis-McChord Fish and Wildlife program; Oregon Zoo; Washington State Department of Corrections","US Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service); US Department of Defense through the Army Compatible Use Buffer program; Joint Base Lewis-McChord Fish and Wildlife program; Oregon Zoo; Washington State Department of Corrections","Many researchers, land managers, organizations, and agencies have contributed to the recovery efforts for golden paintbrush and Taylor's checkerspot, and to the formative discussions described herein.

Longer floral tubes, a trait associated with long-tongued pollinators, can also exclude other pollinators from accessing rewards, a potential mechanism for specialization. Across most of its range, Castilleja sessiliflora displays much longer corollas than most Castilleja species, though tube length varies geographically and correlates partially with hawkmoth visitation. To assess whether long corolla tubes reflect adaptation to hawkmoth pollinators, we performed a day/night pollinator exclusion experiment in nine natural populations that varied in corolla length across the range of C. sessiliflora and short-tubed members of the parapatric C. purpurea complex. We compared the fitness contributions of nocturnal and diurnal visitors, revealing that long-tubed populations visited predominantly by hawkmoths experienced greater fruit set at night, in contrast with short-tubed populations or those visited mainly by diurnal pollinators. Next, leveraging a range-wide multiyear dataset of pollinator visitation to these species, we identify that hawkmoth visitation is associated with increased fitness in long-tubed populations overall, and that long tubes are associated with less diverse visitor assemblages. Thus, long corollas represent an adaptation to hawkmoth pollination at the exclusion of diverse pollinators. Nonetheless, while hawkmoths were scarce in the northern range, secondary diurnal pollinators contributed to fruit set across the range, providing reproductive assurance despite possible trait mismatch. This study illustrates adaptive generalization in pollination systems and that floral divergence may proceed along a continuum of generalized and specialized pollinator interactions.","[Wenzell, Katherine E.] Calif Acad Sci, Bot Dept, 55 Mus Concourse Dr, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Wenzell, Katherine E.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD USA; [Zhang, Johnathan Y.] Boston Univ, Interdisciplinary Programs Bioinformat, Boston, MA USA; [Skogen, Krissa A.] Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clemson, SC USA; [Fant, Jeremie B.] Northwestern Univ, Program Plant Biol & Conservat, Evanston, IL USA; [Fant, Jeremie B.] Chicago Bot Garden, Negaunee Inst Plant Conservat Sci & Act, Glencoe, IL USA","California Academy of Sciences; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Boston University; Clemson University; Northwestern University","Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), Calif Acad Sci, Bot Dept, 55 Mus Concourse Dr, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA.","kewenzell@gmail.com","","Wenzell, Katherine/0000-0002-1635-5485","Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; Nature Conservancy Chapters of TX and IL, Native Prairies Association of Texas, City of Lubbock, TX, TX Parks and Wildlife Department, NM Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, IL Nature Preserves Commission, IL Department of Natural Resources; US Forest Service; American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant; Friends of Nachusa Grasslands, Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation [DGE-1842165]; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship award; Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation and Action at the Chicago Botanic Garden","Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; Nature Conservancy Chapters of TX and IL, Native Prairies Association of Texas, City of Lubbock, TX, TX Parks and Wildlife Department, NM Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, IL Nature Preserves Commission, IL Department of Natural Resources; US Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant; Friends of Nachusa Grasslands, Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation and Action at the Chicago Botanic Garden","The authors thank A.

Since the arrival of European settlers, several factors have reduced available native host plants for E. e. taylori larvae. The most common host is now Plantago lanceolata, an exotic species long prevalent in the area. Local biologists have observed that the known native hosts have low available biomass relative to P. lanceolata, and may senesce too early to support the animals throughout their entire larval feeding cycle. Federally threatened Castilleja levisecta, which often grows larger and persists longer than currently-utilized native hosts, may have been important historically but its range does not now overlap with E. e. taylori. Previous work with other E. editha ssp. has shown that oviposition preference is: 1) heritable and may provide clues to which hosts were used historically, and 2) has been correlated with larval success so might indicate which hosts would be most effective for population restoration. We undertook an oviposition preference experiment to determine which potential hosts were preferred by E. e. taylori among P. lanceolata, C. levisecta, and the more common congener, C. hispida. The two Castilleja spp. were preferred equally, but C. levisecta was preferred over P. lanceolata. If further research confirms the suitability of C. levisecta as a host for E. e. taylori, restoration efforts for the two species could be united, and the effectiveness of both might be synergistically increased.","[Buckingham, Dennis Aubrey; Landa, Carolina; Mullen, Lisa; Leroy, Carri] Evergreen State Coll, Environm Studies Program, 2700 Evergreen Pkwy NW, Olympia, WA 98505 USA; [Linders, Mary] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, 600 Capitol Way N, Olympia, WA 98501 USA; [Buckingham, Dennis Aubrey] JBLM DPW ED Fish & Wildlife, 1210 Mann Ave, Ft Lewis, WA 98433 USA","Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife (WDFW)","Buckingham, DA (corresponding author), Evergreen State Coll, Environm Studies Program, 2700 Evergreen Pkwy NW, Olympia, WA 98505 USA.;Buckingham, DA (corresponding author), JBLM DPW ED Fish & Wildlife, 1210 Mann Ave, Ft Lewis, WA 98433 USA.","denbuckingham@gmail.com","LeRoy, Carri J./AFM-0888-2022","LeRoy, Carri J./0000-0002-1185-4437","US Fish and Wildlife Service grant (Recovery Funding Program); MCCCW administration","US Fish and Wildlife Service grant (Recovery Funding Program); MCCCW administration","The butterfly rearing facility at Mission Creek Corrections Center for Women is managed by the Sustainability in Prisons Project, in partnership with the Washington Department of Corrections and The Evergreen State College.

Yet because intra- and interspecific competition can be caused by different mechanisms, their effect on the ecology and evolution of plants may differ To determine the relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition for pollination, I manipulated the presence of heterospecifics and density of conspecifics using Ipomopsis aggregata as the focal species. All plots contained I. aggregata and Castilleja linariaefolia, but C. linariaefolia inflorescences were removed from half of the plots to create the heterospecifics-absent treatment. Within each plot, all I. aggregata inflorescences were removed from a 5-m radius around a focal plant to create a low conspecific density experimental unit, and a group of 12 1. aggregata plants/1 m(2) was designated as a high conspecific density unit. Conspecific pollen deposition was reduced when C. linariaefolia was present but was not influenced by I. aggregata density. Although seed set per fruit was reduced by 17% when C. linariaefolia was present, it was not significantly influenced by either treatment. Interspecific competition for pollination is stronger than intraspecific competition in the I. aggregata-C. linariaefolia system, but neither process appears to influence plant fitness.","Univ Illinois, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Caruso, CM (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, Shelford Vivarium,606 E Healy St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.","","","Caruso, Christina/0000-0001-7069-9572","","","",NA,"43","60","66","7","34","BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC","COLUMBUS","OHIO STATE UNIV-DEPT BOTANY 1735 NEIL AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA","0002-9122","","","AM J BOT","Am.

Hemiparasites are postulated to be keystone species in grassland communities if they suppress dominant species and increase plant community biodiversity, and ecosystem engineers if they increase nutrient accessibility for surrounding species. We examined keystone effects by evaluating species richness and evenness in 1 m2 plots in a recent prairie restoration where Castilleja sessiliflora was naturally present or absent, and in a longer-established prairie restoration with or without Pedicularis canadensis. We examined ecosystem engineer effects by determining nitrate and phosphate concentrations under, 25 cm from, and 50 cm from hemiparasites, and in the center of hemiparasite-free plots. On the C. sessiliflora site, plots with the hemiparasites had higher species richness due to more forbs and higher floristic quality, consistent with the keystone species hypothesis. Soil phosphate levels were also greater in plots with C. sessiliflora present, consistent with the hypothesis of ecosystem engineering by this hemiparasite. In contrast, plots with/without P. canadensis showed no associations of any community metrics with the hemiparasite, and no correspondence between the presence of hemiparasites and soil nutrients. Although hemiparasites can increase grassland community heterogeneity, the effect is not universal, and the direction and strength of effects likely depends on local conditions.","[Scheidel, Anna; Borowicz, Victoria] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Scheidel, Anna] Champaign Cty Forest Preserve Dist, 109 Lake Woods Rd, Mahomet, IL 61853 USA","Illinois State University","Borowicz, V (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA.","vaborow@ilstu.edu","","","Friends of Nachusa Grasslands","Friends of Nachusa Grasslands","We thank M.

Variation in the impacts of hemiparasites on diversity and production could be due to the difference in the relative strength of two interacting pathways: direct negative effects of parasitism and positive effects on N availability via litter. Strong effects of parasitism should result in substantial changes in diversity and declines in productivity. Conversely, strong litter effects should result in minor changes in diversity and increased productivity. We conducted field-based surveys to determine the association of Castilleja occidentalis with diversity and productivity in the alpine tundra. To examine litter effects, we compared the decomposition of Castilleja litter with litter of four other abundant plant species, and examined the decomposition of those four species when mixed with Castilleja. Castilleja was associated with minor changes in diversity but almost a twofold increase in productivity and greater foliar N in co-occurring species. Our decomposition trials suggest litter effects are due to both the rapid N loss of Castilleja litter and the effects of mixing Castilleja litter with co-occurring species. Castilleja produces litter that accelerates decomposition in the alpine tundra, which could accelerate the slow N cycle and boost productivity. We speculate that these positive effects of litter outweigh the effects of parasitism in nutrient-poor systems with long-lived hemiparasites. Determining the relative importance of parasitism and litter effects of this functional group is crucial to understand the strong but variable roles hemiparasites play in affecting community structure and ecosystem processes.","[Spasojevic, Marko J.; Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","University of California System; University of California Irvine","Spasojevic, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.","mspasoje@uci.edu","SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/AAO-4307-2020; Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017","SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/0000-0003-1808-0048; Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176","Andrew W.

By reducing the abundance of dominant plants and releasing subordinates from competitive exclusion, they can have an outsized impact on plant communities. Most research on the ecological role of hemiparasites is manipulative and focuses on a small number of hemiparasitic taxa. Here, we ask whether patterns in natural plant communities match the expectation that hemiparasites affect the structure of plant communities. Our data were collected on 129 national park units spanning the continental United States. The most common hemiparasite genera were Pedicularis, Castilleja, Krameria, and Comandra. We used null models and linear mixed models to determine whether hemiparasites were associated with changes in community richness and evenness. Hemiparasite presence did not affect community metrics. Hemiparasite abundance was positively associated with increasing evenness of herbaceous species, but not with species richness. The associations that we observed on a continental scale are consistent with evidence that the impacts of root hemiparasitic plants on evenness can be substantial and abundance dependent but that effects on richness are less pronounced. Hemiparasites mediate competitive exclusion in communities to facilitate species coexistence and merit consideration of inclusion in ecological theories of coexistence.","[Hodzic, Jasna; Bakker, Jonathan D.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Pearse, Ian] US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Beaury, Evelyn M.] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Organism & Evolutionary Biol Grad Program, Amherst, MA USA; [Corbin, Jeffrey D.] Union Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Union College","Hodzic, J (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","jhodzic@uw.edu","","Corbin, Jeffrey/0000-0002-3377-5916; Beaury, Evelyn/0000-0002-7971-3593; Hodzic, Jasna/0000-0001-5011-8830; Bakker, Jonathan/0000-0002-8973-2771","Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP); National Science Foundation [DGE-1762114]","Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP); National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DGE-1762114",NA,"63","2","2","6","21","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0012-9658","1939-9170","","ECOLOGY","Ecology","DEC","2022","103","12",NA,"","","","","","","10.1002/ecy.3837","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3837","","SEP 2022","13","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","6S4CV","36178041","hybrid, Green Published",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000861821200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The autotroph Scrophularia nodosa (Scrophulariaceae) has been chosen as a control. It is shown that the main preconditions providing the possibility of rapid haustorium development are the long life of the primary outermost tissue of the root - the rhizodermis that covers the entire length of both young and older roots, and constant readiness of this tissue to form special haustorial hairs, and also an unusual structure of exodermis, which in many details is similar to rhizodermis. The formation of haustorial hairs is one of the earliest structural events in haustorium development; the haustorial hairs are long, with a smooth surface. The division and elongation of cells in the outer tissues play a major role in the early stages of endophyte development.

Since European settlement ca. 1840, GOE sites have been largely degraded by human disturbance, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, overgrazing, and fire suppression. A key strategy to mitigate this loss of biodiversity is to translocate rare plants to GOE restoration sites. The Garry Oak Ecosystem Recovery Team provides advice on proposed translocations but strongly encourages restoration practitioners to focus on plant populations already present on a site. There is a need for a closer look at challenges and opportunities afforded by translocation. If the approach taken is too precautionary, some rare species in this highly threatened ecosystem may be jeopardized. Current translocation efforts are being spearheaded by Parks Canada for golden paintbrush (Castilleja levisecta Greenm.), seaside birds-foot lotus (Lotus formossimus Greene), and white-top aster (Aster curtus Cronq.). Translocations like these together with further research on the genetics and ecology of rare plant species are critical to species recovery efforts within GOE and other similarly compromised ecosystems.","Trinity Western Univ, Dept Biol, Langley, BC V2Y 1Y1, Canada","Trinity Western University","Clements, DR (corresponding author), Trinity Western Univ, Dept Biol, 7600 Glover Rd, Langley, BC V2Y 1Y1, Canada.","clements@twu.ca","","","","","",NA,"66","9","11","1","107","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS","OTTAWA","65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA","1916-2790","1916-2804","","BOTANY","Botany","MAY","2013","91","5",NA,"","","","283","291","","10.1139/cjb-2012-0269","http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2012-0269","","","9","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","142EZ",NA,"",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000318780700003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Dust particles and pollen grains are similar in size. Dust deposition might therefore influence the pollination and reproduction of flowering plants. Little is known about such effects, however, despite more general interest in ecological effects of dust. Methodology. We used observational and experimental methods to explore whether dust generated by traffic on unpaved roads affects the amounts of pollen received and numbers of seeds produced by four species of native wildflowers in the western United States. Pivotal results. Flowers of Nuttall's larkspur (Delphinium nuttallianum), scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis aggregata), Lewis flax (Linumlewisii), and sulphur paintbrush (Castilleja sulphurea) growing 1-2mfrom a road received substantially more dust and less pollen than those growing 40-50 m away. We observed the same pattern when we transplanted individuals of the first two species into pots and placed pots near to compared with far from a road. Experimental hand dusting of scarlet gilia and Lewis flax plants also reduced stigma pollen loads to a degree that resembled the average effect of road proximity for those species. On the other hand, numbers of seeds per flower (seed set) did not vary consistently for any species as a function of road proximity or hand-dusting treatment. Conclusions. Several mechanisms might contribute to the different effects of dust on pollen loads and seed set. Wediscuss four possible mechanisms, which we refer to as pollen excess, pollen quality, resource limitation, and compensatory herbivory. These mechanisms suggest avenues for further study of dust, pollination, and plant reproduction with this and other systems.","[Waser, Nickolas M.; Price, Mary V.; Casco, Genesis; Diaz, Maria; Morales, Asia Liza; Solverson, Jennie] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, POB 519, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Waser, Nickolas M.; Price, Mary V.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","University of Arizona","Waser, NM (corresponding author), Rocky Mt Biol Labs, POB 519, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA.;Waser, NM (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.","nickolas.waser@ucr.edu","","","Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL); US National Science Foundation; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [1262713] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","Thanks to Kaitlin Griffith, Molly MacLeod, and Katty Paulino for help in the field; to Paul CaraDonna, Amy Iler, Janette Steets, and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on manuscript drafts; and to the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) and the US National Science Foundation (through Research Experience for Undergraduates grants to the RMBL) for logistical and financial support.",NA,"41","15","16","1","56","UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","CHICAGO","1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","1058-5893","1537-5315","","INT J PLANT SCI","Int.

For example, parasitic plants obtain defensive compounds as well as nutrients from their hosts, and thus many attributes of parasitic plants are dependent on the quality of their host species. Here I measure the effect of a lupine host species (Lupinus argenteus) compared to other host species on herbivory, pollination, and female plant fitness in the hemiparasite Indian paintbrush (Castilleja miniata) using a series of field experiments. Association with lupine was determined in the field by assaying Indian paintbrush leaves for lupine alkaloids. I found that Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines experienced reduced herbivory from plume moth larvae, agromyzid fly larvae, and deer, relative to Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing other host species. However, there was no correlation between alkaloid content of inflorescences and plume moth performance. Host species did not affect pollinator preference for Indian paintbrush in the field. Indian paintbrush parasitizing lupines produced twice as many seeds overall as Indian paintbrush parasitizing other host species. Correlations suggest that this benefit arises both from reduced herbivory and increased nitrogenous resources. The reduction of herbivory in Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines indicates that host species can affect performance of hemiparasites via indirect pathways, and that the larger community of herbivores could alter the impact of a host on its plant parasites.","Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis","Adler, LS (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Biol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.","","","","","","",NA,"67","30","36","0","54","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","0012-9658","","","ECOLOGY","Ecology","OCT","2002","83","10",NA,"","","","2700","2710","","10.2307/3072008","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3072008","","","11","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","617ER",NA,"Green Submitted",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000179348800005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Invasive removal programs on islands are conservation efforts that can also be viewed as powerful manipulative experiments, but few data are available to evaluate their effects. We collected demographic and herbivore damage data for Castilleja mollis Pennell, an endangered plant endemic to Santa Rosa Island, California, over a 12-year period before, during, and after the implementation of control for introduced cattle, deer, and elk. We used these long-term data to explore mechanisms underlying herbivore effects, assess the results of herbivore reduction at the scales of both individual plants and populations, and determine how temporal variability in herbivory and plant demography influenced responses to herbivore removals. For individual plants, herbivore effects mediated by disturbance were greater than those of grazing. Deer and elk scraping of the ground substantially increased plant mortality and dormancy and reduced flowering and growth. Stem damage from browsing did not affect survivorship but significantly reduced plant growth and flower production. Herbivore control successfully lowered damage rates, which declined steeply between 1997 and 2000 and have remained relatively low. Castilleja mollis abundances rose sharply after 1997, suggesting a positive effect of herbivore control, but then began to decline steadily again after 2003. The recent decline appears to be driven by higher mean growing season temperatures; interestingly, not only reductions in scraping damage but a period of cooler conditions were significant in explaining increases in C. mollis populations between 1997 and 2002. Our results demonstrate strong effects of introduced herbivores on both plant demography and population dynamics and show that climate-driven variation may counteract and mask positive responses to herbivore removal. Regional mean temperatures already have risen significantly over the last 50 years, suggesting that climate change could increasingly swamp the effects of management targeted at other environmental problems. Similar interactions between climate and invasive species will play an even greater role in future management, with long-term data sets like this critical to quantifying such effects.","[McEachern, A.

Net selection on plant traits, such as defensive chemistry, may be difficult to predict from studying either of these interactions in isolation. In this study, alkaloids were manipulated experimentally in the hemiparasitic annual plant Castilleja indivisa (Scrophulariaceae; Indian paintbrush) by growing these parasites with bitter (high-alkaloid) or sweet (low-alkaloid) near-isogenic lines of the host Lupinus albus (Fabaceae) in the field. To evaluate the effect of herbivores. half of the Indian paintbrush plants were randomly assigned to a reduced-herbivory treatment using insecticide, and the other half to a natural-herbivory treatment. Floral traits. bud and fruit herbivory, pollination, alkaloids, and plant performance were measured. These variables were used in a path analysis to dissect the direct and indirect effects of herbivory and pollination on lifetime seed set, and the direct and indirect effects of alkaloids on seed set via herbivory and pollination. Bud herbivory and fruit herbivory directly decreased seed production, whereas pollination had a direct positive effect. In addition, bud herbivory had negative indirect effects on seed set by reducing the number of open flowers, which reduced pollinator visits. Alkaloids directly reduced bud herbivory but did not significantly affect pollination or fruit herbivory directly. However, because bud herbivory indirectly reduced seed set by reducing pollinator visits to flowers. alkaloids also had additional indirect benefits for plants by increasing pollination. Overall. the net benefit of alkaloid uptake was due to both reduction in herbivory and an increase in pollinator visits to flowers. This study demonstrates the importance of considering multiple interactions simultaneously when attempting to understand the mechanisms underlying correlations between plant traits and fitness.","Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis","Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, 2320 Storer Hall,1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","lsadler@vt.edu","","Strauss, Sharon/0000-0002-6117-4085","","","",NA,"80","112","135","3","116","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0012-9658","1939-9170","","ECOLOGY","Ecology","JUL","2001","82","7",NA,"","","","2032","2044","","","","","","13","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","457FC",NA,"Green Submitted",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000170125600020","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Parasitic plants obtain water, sugar, nitrogen compounds, and a variety of secondary metabolites from their host plants. In a greenhouse study, I examined the direct interactions of a parasitic plant, Castilleja wightii (Scrophulariaceae), with three plant hosts and the indirect effects of this parasitism on the performance of a parasite-feeding herbivore. The three host species, Lupinus arboreus, Artemisia pycnocephala, and Eriophyllum staechadifolium, directly and differentially affected C. wightii flower production, although parasite biomass was not affected by host species. Surprisingly, parasite performance was weakest when attacking a leguminous host, although parasite total nitrogen was highest when growing on a legume. Parasites also exerted a strong direct effect on host performance: host dry mass was negatively correlated with parasite mass for all three host species tested. However, this effect differed among hosts: for E. staechadifolium, proportionately larger parasite mass was correlated with smaller overall biomass of the host and parasite combined, while for the other two hosts, overall host-parasite mass was not correlated with parasite mass, indicating that E. staechadifolium was more affected by parasite attack than were the other host species. Finally, host plant chemistry had strong indirect effects on the performance of an aphid, Nearctaphis kachena, that feeds on C. wightii. Aphids feeding on C. wightii that were parasitizing L. arboreus (alkaloid-producing, high nitrogen), A. pycnocephala (alkaloid-free, intermediate nitrogen), and E. staechadifolium (terpenoid-producing, low nitrogen) experienced 68.2, 65.3, and 49.5% survival, respectively. Further, aphids feeding on parasites using L. arboreus and A. pycnocephala produced 2.43 and 1.77 times more offspring on average than those feeding on parasites using E. staechadifolium. My results indicate that interactions between plant parasites and different host species can have strong direct effects on both host and parasite performance, as well as marked effects on the tritrophic interactions among plant hosts, parasitic plants, and their herbivores.","","","Marvier, MA (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ, BIOL BOARD, SANTA CRUZ, CA 95064 USA.","","","Marvier, Michelle/0000-0001-8360-9265","","","",NA,"65","74","80","0","51","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0012-9658","","","ECOLOGY","Ecology","JUL","1996","77","5",NA,"","","","1398","1409","","10.2307/2265537","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2265537","","","12","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","UX396",NA,"",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:A1996UX39600010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To investigate the relative importance of plant traits in such interactions, we studied the role of the root hemiparasite, Castilleja levisecta (Orobanchaceae), as a mediator of interactions between the host plants it parasitizes and the lepidopteran herbivore Euphydryas editha (Nymphalidae), whose caterpillars feed on Castilleja and sequester iridoid glycosides from it. We tested whether the hemiparasite's size, leaf N concentration, and iridoid glycoside concentrations were influenced by the identity of its host plant, and then whether these traits influenced outcomes for the herbivore. We found that the hemiparasite's size and leaf N depended on the host it parasitized, and these traits in turn affected outcomes for E.editha. Specifically, Euphydryas editha survival increased with hemiparasite size and caterpillar mass increased with leaf N; caterpillars with greater mass were more likely to survive during diapause. We also found preliminary evidence that host identity influenced iridoid glycoside sequestration by the herbivore. Mean iridoid glycoside concentrations in caterpillars ranged from 1-12% depending on the host being parasitized by Castilleja. This study demonstrates that root parasitism can result in strong indirect effects on higher trophic levels, influencing organisms' survival, growth, and chemical interactions.","[Haan, Nathan L.; Bakker, Jonathan D.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 354115, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bowers, M.

A primary prediction of this hypothesis is that the strength of competition for pollination, mediated by variation in plant abundance, should directly influence the strength of selection on floral traits. To test this prediction., I examined the relationships between multiple components of plant abundance and pollination, reproductive success. and phenotypic selection via female fitness on four floral traits in artificial and natural populations of the hummingbird-pollinated Ipomoposis aggregata. In the artificial arrays, I manipulated the absolute density and interspersion of neighboring I. aggregata and a competitor for pollination (Castilleja linariaefolia). I also measured natural variation in the absolute and relative density of these two species within a 2.5-m radius of focal L aggregata plants in three natural populations. The strength of competition for pollination in the L aggregata-C. linariaefolia system was only weakly influenced by local plant abundance. Both the absolute density and interspersion of plants in the arrays significantly influenced at least one component of L aggregata's pollination and reproductive Success. but the effects were not consistent across these components. For example, the treatment groups that received more conspecific pollen were not the same ones that set more seeds/fruit. Within the natural populations. variation in relative and absolute plant density influenced two components of I. aggregata's pollination and reproductive success, but only in one to two populations per component. As would be expected from these inconsistent effects of plant abundance on pollination and reproduction, the strength of selection on floral traits of L aggregata in both the arrays and natural populations was also only weakly dependent on abundance. Previous studies have indicated (1) that self-incompatible species such as I. aggregata should experience strong, abundance-dependent effects on pollination, and (2) that variation in plant abundance at a local scale should have a stronger effect on pollination than variation at a larger spatial scale. In contrast, my results suggest that the effect of plant abundance on pollination cannot be easily predicted from simple diagnostic traits such as breeding system or spatial scale.","Univ Illinois, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Caruso, CM (corresponding author), Grinnell Coll, Dept Biol, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA.","","","Caruso, Christina/0000-0001-7069-9572","","","",NA,"64","32","33","3","31","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","WASHINGTON","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","0012-9658","","","ECOLOGY","Ecology","JAN","2002","83","1",NA,"","","","241","254","","10.2307/2680135","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2680135","","","14","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","508YQ",NA,"",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000173117700021","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Based on a well-resolved and well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis, we present a formal reclassification of the major lineages comprising the Castillejinae. Prior to this treatment, subtribe Castillejinae included Castilleja (ca. 190 spp.), Cordylanthus (18 spp.), Orthocarpus (9 spp.), Triphysaria (5 spp.), and the monotypic genera Clevelandia and Ophiocephalus. In the classification presented here, Orthocarpus and Triphysaria retain their current circumscriptions, Castilleja is expanded to include Clevelandia and Ophiocephalus, and Cordylanthus is split into three genera; a key to the genera as they are recognized here is provided. Two new combinations, Castilleja beldingii and Castilleja ophiocephala, are proposed within the expanded Castilleja. The concept of Cordylanthus is restricted to the 13 species formerly recognized as subg. Cordylanthus, while subg. Dicranostegia and subg. Hemistegia are elevated to genus level (Dicranostegia and Chloropyron, respectively). We resurrect the generic name Chloropyron for the halophytes previously recognized as subg. Hemistegia. Five new combinations are proposed for Chloropyron (Chloropyron maritimum subsp. canescens, Chloropyron maritimum subsp. palustre, Chloropyron molle subsp. hispidum, Chloropyron palmatum, and Chloropyron tecopense). In addition to the formal classification, we provide phylogenetic clade definitions for Castillejinae, each of the genera, and two additional clades that are not assigned formal ranks. Morphological characteristics used to recognize traditional groups are evaluated, and synapomorphies are discussed. Finally, the current infrageneric classifications for Castilleja and Cordylanthus are evaluated in light of the recent molecular phylogenetic analyses.","[Egger, J.

The phylogenetic relationships of the subtribe are investigated, using 26 characters from morphology and cytology. Seven genera, three subgenera, and three sections are considered to be terminal for the subtribe. Polarity of the characters is based on outgroup comparison. Three equally parsimonious trees and a strict consensus tree were generated, each with 35 steps (homoplasy 34.3%) and a consistent index of 0.743. This analysis strongly supports Chuang and Heckard's placement of the species previously assigned to the genus Orthocarpus into three genera, namely Orthocarpus, Triphysaria, and Castilleja, and relegation of the monotypic genus Gentrya to subgeneric status in Castilleja. This cladistic analysis supports most of our previously proposed classification and phylogenetic arrangement of the subtribe.","","","CHUANG, TI (corresponding author), ILLINOIS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,NORMAL,IL 61761, USA.","","","","","","",NA,"19","3","3","0","1","ACAD SINICA INST BOTANY","TAIPEI","NANKANG, TAIPEI 11529, TAIWAN","0006-8063","","","BOT BULL ACAD SINICA","Bot.

In closely related species, we might expect the strength of host-associated genomic differentiation (HAD) to be correlated with the degree of phenotypic differentiation in host-adaptive traits. Using microsatellite and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers, and controlling for isolation by distance between populations, we sought HAD in two congeneric species of butterflies with different degrees of host plant specialization. Prior work on Euphydryas editha had shown strong interpopulation differentiation in host-adapted traits, resulting in incipient reproductive isolation among host-associated ecotypes. We show here that Euphydryas aurinia had much weaker host-associated phenotypic differentiation. Contrary to our expectations, we detected HAD in Euphydryas aurinia, but not in E.editha. Even within an E.aurinia population that fed on both hosts, we found weak but significant sympatric HAD that persisted in samples taken 9years apart. The finding of significantly stronger HAD in the system with less phenotypic differentiation may seem paradoxical. Our findings can be explained by multiple factors, ranging from differences in dispersal or effective population size, to spatial variation in genomic or phenotypic traits and to structure induced by past histories of host-adapted populations. Other infrequently measured factors, such as differences in recombination rates, may also play a role. Our result adds to recent work as a further caution against assumptions of simple relationships between genomic and adaptive phenotypic differentiation.","[Mikheyev, Alexander S.] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Okinawa 9040495, Japan; [McBride, Carolyn S.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neurogenet & Behav, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Mueller, Ulrich G.; Parmesan, Camille; Singer, Michael C.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Parmesan, Camille] Univ Plymouth, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Smee, Melanie R.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Stefanescu, Constanti] Museo Ciencies Nat, Catalan Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, Granollers 08402, Spain; [Stefanescu, Constanti] CREAF, Global Ecol Unit, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Wee, Brian] Smithsonian Inst, NEON Inc, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Singer, Michael C.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Biomed & Biol Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England","Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University; Rockefeller University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Plymouth; University of York - UK; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF-CERCA); Smithsonian Institution; University of Plymouth","Mikheyev, AS (corresponding author), Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Okinawa 9040495, Japan.","sasha@homologo.us","Mikheyev, Alexander/E-7999-2013; Singer, Michael/IZE-9090-2023; Smee, Melanie R/K-4201-2015; Wee, Brian Peck-Sheng P/B-8774-2016; Parmesan, Camille/GVT-5674-2022","Mikheyev, Alexander/0000-0003-4369-1019; Singer, Michael/0000-0002-0277-534X; Parmesan, Camille/0000-0002-1515-274X","San Diego Foundation; NSF [DEB-0215436, DEB-0815145]; Ulrich Mueller; Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","San Diego Foundation; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Ulrich Mueller; Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology(Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University); Howard Hughes Medical Institute(Howard Hughes Medical Institute)","We are most grateful to Jordi Artola, Agnes Batlle, Rafel Carbonell, Henri Descimon, Juexin Jiang, Mark Kirkpatrick, Michael Lockwood, James Mallet, Toni Marine, Joan Strassman, Tanya Vo and Chris Wheat.

Here, we report on experimental pollinations using foreign pollen from two co-flowering species that share pollinators with P. viscosum. Experiments were designed to ascertain whether improper pollen transfer causes reduced seed set under controlled conditions and, if so, to determine the stage at which interference occurs. In flowers pre-treated by pollination with either Mertensia or Castilleja pollen, adherence of subsequently deposited conspecific pollen grains was unaffected. However, conspecific grains had significantly lower germination and ovule fertization success in flowers receiving foreign pollen than in controls. These results suggest that pollinator infidelity in high alpine plant communities can reduce female reproductive success of P. viscosum by inhibiting the performance of conspecific pollen grains. Negative effects of Mertensia and Castilleja pollen were comparable despite large interspecific differences in pollen grain morphology. Accordingly, susceptibility to foreign pollen interference appears to be an intrinsic property of P. viscosum that is not dependent on the unique structural properties of pollen produced by competitive species.","","","BOWLING GREEN STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, BOWLING GREEN, OH 43403 USA.","","","","","","",NA,"25","141","161","2","57","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0029-8549","1432-1939","","OECOLOGIA","Oecologia","","1989","81","1",NA,"","","","120","123","","10.1007/BF00377020","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00377020","","","4","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","AT033","28312167","",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:A1989AT03300020","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Outcomes for butterfly conservation can hinge on interactions with host plants during early larval instars. Ontogenetic changes in larvae may cause predictors of survival to shift quickly over time. 2. Survival from instar to instar was measured for an endangered oligophagous butterfly, Euphydryas editha ssp. taylori (Taylor's checkerspot), which was experimentally released in the field on three host plants: Castilleja levisecta, Castilleja hispida, and Plantago lanceolata. Survival rates were quantified, from hatching to the second instar, from the second to the third instar, and from the third to the fourth instar. 3. This study tested whether host plant characteristics (degree of senescence and anthocyanin pigmentation) affected survival during each instar; the effects of oviposition timing and larval group size on survival were also tested, as these vary by group and could affect outcomes for larvae differently on different hosts. 4. Survival rates depended on the host species being consumed, mostly because of a disparity in survival during the transition from the second to the third instar. Survival was lowest on C. levisecta, intermediate on C. hispida, and highest on P. lanceolata. 5. Plant senescence, oviposition timing, and group size were predictors of survival, but their relevance depended on both the host plant being used and the instar being considered. 6.

Experiments to restore abandoned agricultural fields from exotic grassland to coastal sage scrub habitat were conducted over two years in southern California, U.S.A. Grass control methods were tested in 5 m(2) plots using soil and vegetation treatments seeded with a mix of natives. The treatments compared grass-specific herbicide, mowing, and black plastic winter solarization with disking and a control. In year two, herbicide and mowing treatments were repeated on the first-year plots, plus new control and solarization plots were added. Treatments were evaluated using percent cover, richness and biomass of native and exotic plants. Disking alone reduced exotic grasses, but solarization was the most effective control in both years even without soil sterilization, and produced the highest cover of natives. Native richness was greatest in solarization and herbicide plots. Herbicide application reduced exotics and increased natives more than disking or mowing, but produced higher exotic forb biomass than solarization in the second year. Mowing reduced grass biomass and cover in both years, but did not improve native establishment more than disking. Solarization was the most effective restoration method, but grass-specific herbicide may be a valuable addition or alternative. Solarization using black plastic could improve restoration in regions with cool, wet summers or winter growing seasons by managing exotic seedbanks prior to seeding. While solarization may be impractical at very large scales, it will be useful for rapid establishment of annual assemblages on small scales.","[Marushia, Robin G.; Allen, Edith B.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Allen, Edith B.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of California System; University of California Riverside","Allen, EB (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.","edith.allen@ucr.edu","","","California Department of Fish and Game","California Department of Fish and Game","We thank Alison Anderson of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Eliza Maher of the Center for Natural Lands Management for encouragement and logistic support, Christopher True, Robert Steers, Sara Jo Dickens, and Sheila Kee for field assistance, and the California Department of Fish and Game for their funding.

Using a hemiparasitic plant that takes up secondary compounds from host plants, I experimentally manipulated secondary compounds in planta and assessed their effects on herbivores and pollinators in the field. Here, I show that the uptake of alkaloids in the annual hemiparasite Castilleja indivisa resulted in decreased herbivory, increased visitation by pollinators, and increased lifetime seed production. These results indicate that resistance trails such as alkaloids can increase plant fitness directly by reducing herbivore attack and indirectly by increasing pollinator visitation to defended plants. Thus, selection for production of secondary compounds may be underestimated by considering only the direct effect of herbivores on plant fitness.","Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis","Adler, LS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","lsadler@ucdavis.edu","","","","","",NA,"47","70","77","0","56","UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","CHICAGO","1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","0003-0147","","","AM NAT","Am.

In the mid-2000s, a non-native plant pathogen from Europe, invaded Taylor's checkerspot populations causing English plantain leaves to die in the winter when Taylor's checkerspot larvae are feeding. We characterized butterfly and larval food plant (native and non-native) timing in Oregon and Washington populations and discovered that the invasive plant disease is active for similar to 60 days when larvae are feeding in January, February and March. Only one native larval foodplant, the annual Collinsia parviflora, can provide food for caterpillars during the time the plantain disease is common. However, this plant is rare in Taylor's checkerspot habitat and may only be suitably timed to Washington checkerspot populations. Other native perennial larval food plants (Castilleja levisecta and likely C. hispida) do not appear suitably timed to provide resources throughout the entire Taylor's checkerspot lifecycle in the low-elevation English plantain dependent populations. Understanding and accounting for the plant population disease dynamics is essential for the long-term conservation of Taylor's checkerspot butterfly. Abstract: New plant pathogen invasions typified by cryptic disease symptoms or those appearing sporadically in time and patchily in space, might go largely unnoticed and not taken seriously by ecologists. We present evidence that the recent invasion of Pyrenopeziza plantaginis (Dermateaceae) into the Pacific Northwest USA, which causes foliar necrosis in the fall and winter on Plantago lanceolata (plantain), the primary (non-native) foodplant for six of the eight extant Taylor's checkerspot butterfly populations (Euphydryas editha taylori, endangered species), has altered eco-evolutionary foodplant interactions to a degree that threatens butterfly populations with extinction. Patterns of butterfly, larval food plant, and P. plantaginis disease development suggested the ancestral relationship was a two-foodplant system, with perennial Castilleja spp. supporting oviposition and pre-diapause larvae, and the annual Collinsia parviflora supporting post-diapause larvae. Plantain, in the absence of P. plantaginis disease, provided larval food resources throughout all butterfly life stages and may explain plantain's initial adoption by Taylor's checkerspot. However, in the presence of severe P. plantaginis disease, plantain-dependent butterfly populations experience a six-week period in the winter where post-diapause larvae lack essential plantain resources. Only C. parviflora, which is rare and competitively inferior under present habitat conditions, can fulfill the post-diapause larval feeding requirements in the presence of severe P. plantaginis disease. However, a germination timing experiment suggested C. parviflora to be suitably timed for only Washington Taylor's checkerspot populations. The recent invasion by P. plantaginis appears to have rendered the ancestrally adaptive acquisition of plantain by Taylor's checkerspot an unreliable, maladaptive foodplant interaction.","[Severns, Paul M.; Guzman-Martinez, Melinda] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Pathol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","University System of Georgia; University of Georgia","Severns, PM (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Pathol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.","Paul.Severns@uga.edu; Melinda.Guzman@uga.edu","","Severns, Paul/0000-0002-8461-424X; Guzman Martinez, Melinda/0000-0002-0083-1766","","","",NA,"37","3","3","2","26","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2075-4450","","INSECTS","Insects","MAR","2021","12","3",NA,"","","","","","246","10.3390/insects12030246","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects12030246","","","11","Entomology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Entomology","RD9JI","33804172","Green Published, gold",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000633784100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

B. antioquensis and P. pulchella extracts showed the best results over a broad spectrum UVA-UVB with antioxidant capacity in vitro. However, B. antioquensis extracts presented the highest absorption coefficient in UVB-UVA range among plants under study. Furthermore, the gel formulation containing the crude extract of B. antioquensis showed significant values of UVAPF, UVA/UVB ratio, critical wavelength ((c)) and SPF (3, 0.78 380 nm and 4.73 +/- 0.26; respectively), indicating interesting photostability and antiradical capacities. All of these properties could be improve in order to satisfy the requirements for broad-spectrum UVB/UVA protection. Finally, P. pulchella and B. antioquensis extracts could be a potential source of a new natural sunscreen compounds with photostable and antiradical properties.","[Mejia-Giraldo, Juan C.; Henao-Zuluaga, Kelly; Puertas-Mejia, Miguel A.] Univ Antioquia, Inst Chem, Res Grp Funct Cpds, Medellin, Colombia; [Gallardo, Cecilia] Univ Antioquia, Fac Pharmaceut Chem, Medellin, Colombia; [Atehortua, Lucia] Univ Antioquia, Biotechnol Grp, Medellin, Colombia","Universidad de Antioquia; Universidad de Antioquia; Universidad de Antioquia","Puertas-Mejía, MA (corresponding author), Univ Antioquia, Inst Chem, Res Grp Funct Cpds, Medellin, Colombia.","miguel.puertas@udea.edu.co","PUERTAS-MEJIA, MIGUEL/AAB-5967-2019; Mejía-Giraldo, Juan/JFJ-2520-2023","PUERTAS-MEJIA, MIGUEL/0000-0002-9962-669X; Mejía-Giraldo, Juan/0000-0002-2722-988X; Mejia-Giraldo, Juan Camilo/0000-0003-4494-1446","Colciencias (National Research Council); CODI-University of Antioquia [IN632CE]","Colciencias (National Research Council); CODI-University of Antioquia","J.C.

All species were strikingly convergent in floral color, size and shape. Hummingbirds, the primary pollinators, usually did not visit flower species selectively, and individual birds often simultaneously carried 4 or more species of pollen. Flowers may have competed interspecifically for these shared pollinators, but competition was reduced because character displacement in orientation of anther and stigma resulted in some species using different parts of the bird to transport their pollen. Most flower species secreted nectar at similar rates, particularly when they bloomed together in mixed stands. A population of L. cardinalis secreted no nectar; it attracted hummingbirds by mimicing more abundant, nectar-producing species. This temperate flower community, which resembles some associations of convergent Mullerian and Batesian mimics, may have evolved its characteristic convergent structure because the advantages of using similar signals and rewards to share the same hummingbird pollinators outweight the advantages of diverging to reduce interspecific competition.","","","UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.","","","","","","",NA,"43","220","234","2","72","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0012-9658","1939-9170","","ECOLOGY","Ecology","","1979","60","5",NA,"","","","1022","1035","","10.2307/1936870","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1936870","","","14","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","JE218",NA,"",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:A1979JE21800018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) is an essential material for molecular breeding and evolution studies. Here, the mitogenome of M. spicata was assembled by combining Nanopore and Illumina reads. It consisted of a linear chromosome (Ch1) and two circular chromosomes (Ch2 and Ch3). Furthermore, we showed two pairs of repeats (R1 and R2) mediated recombinations resulting in multiple chromosomal configurations. The R1-mediated-recombination generated a large molecule formed by joining Ch2 and Ch1. Similarly, the R2-mediated-recombination generated a large molecule formed by joining Ch3 and Ch1. Then, we identified 17 mitochondrial plastid DNAs (MTPTs) by comparing the mitogenome and cpgenome. The MTPT14 was conserved in multiple species, which has undergone the same evolutionary process as the two organellar genomes among M. spicata, Hesperelaea palmeri and Castilleja paramensis. Based on the RNA-seq reads, 246 RNA editing sites were predicted, resulting in the conversion of cytosine to uracil bases. Furthermore, we successfully validated 40 out of 43 predicted sites.

In total, 285 samples of 39 species from 10 holoparasitic genera (Boschniakia C.A.Mey. ex Bong., Boulardia F.W.Schultz, Cistanche Hoffmanns. & Link, Conopholis Wallr., Diphelypaea Nicolson, Epifagus Nutt., Mannagettaea H.Sm., Orobanche L., Phacellanthus Siebold & Zucc. and Phelipanche Pomel) and as an outgroup, of six additional hemiparasitic genera (Castilleja Mutis ex L.f., Euphrasia L., Orthantha (Benth.) A.Kern., Parentucellia Viv., Rhinanthus L., and Striga Lour.) were analysed using both light and scanning electron microscopy. Types of epidermal cells were characterised, and their distribution on the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the petals determined. The following four major epidermal types were recognised: tabular rugose striate cells (TRS), areolate cells (AS), papillose conical cells (PCS) and lobular striate cells (PLS). Two main types of trichomes were observed, namely glandular and non-glandular. Our results showed that petal micromorphology may be useful to systematics; its influence in relation to the pollinators is discussed.","[Piwowarczyk, Renata] Jan Kochanowski Univ, Inst Biol, Dept Bot, 15 Swietokrzyska St, PL-25406 Kielce, Poland; [Kasinska, Justyna] Kielce Univ Technol, Dept Appl Comp Sci & Armament Engn, Fac Mechatron & Mech Engn, Aleja Tysiaclecia Panstwa Polskiego 7, PL-25314 Kielce, Poland","Jan Kochanowski University; Kielce University of Technology","Piwowarczyk, R (corresponding author), Jan Kochanowski Univ, Inst Biol, Dept Bot, 15 Swietokrzyska St, PL-25406 Kielce, Poland.","renata.piwowarczyk@ujk.edu.pl","Piwowarczyk, Renata/ABB-3129-2021; Kasińska, Justyna/AAQ-8161-2020; Piwowarczyk, Renata/AAB-8311-2020","Piwowarczyk, Renata/0000-0003-0507-7835; Kasińska, Justyna/0000-0002-2225-0639;","(Polish) Ministry of Science and Higher Education [NN303551939]; Principal Research Project [612419]","(Polish) Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland); Principal Research Project","We thank Ivan V.

As members of this group may lack some genes widely used for phylogenetic analysis and exhibit varying degrees of accelerated base substitution in other genes, relationships among major clades identified previously remain contentious. To improve inferences of phylogenetic relationships in Orobanchaceae, we used two pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) and three low-copy nuclear (LCN) genes, two of which have been developed for this study. Resolving power and level of support strongly differed among markers. Despite considerable incongruence among newly and previously sequenced markers, monophyly of major clades identified in previous studies was confirmed and, especially in analyses of concatenated data, strongly supported after the exclusion of a small group of East Asian genera (Pterygiella and Phtheirospermum) from the Euphrasia-Rhinanthus clade. The position of the Orobanche clade sister to all other parasitic Orobanchaceae may indicate that the shift to holoparasitism occurred early in the evolution of the family. Although well supported in analyses of concatenated data comprising ten loci (five newly and five previously sequenced), relationships among major clades, most prominently the Striga-Alectra clade, the Euphrasia-Rhinanthus clade, and the Castilleja-Pedicularis clade, were uncertain because of strongly supported incongruence also among well-resolving loci. Despite the limitations of using a few selected loci, congruence among markers with respect to circumscription of major clades of Orobanchaceae renders those frameworks for detailed, species-level, phylogenetic studies.","[Li, Xi; Schneeweiss, Gerald M.] Univ Vienna, Dept Bot & Biodiversrty Res, Vienna, Austria; [Feng, Tao] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Randle, Chris] Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA","University of Vienna; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan Botanical Garden, CAS; Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University","Schneeweiss, GM (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Bot & Biodiversrty Res, Vienna, Austria.","gerald.schneeweiss@univie.ac.at","Schneeweiss, Gerald M./B-4344-2013","Schneeweiss, Gerald M./0000-0003-2811-3317","China Scholarship Council [201206100007]","China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","This study was funded by the China Scholarship Council Grant No. 201206100007 (to XL).",NA,"77","19","19","2","30","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-462X","","","FRONT PLANT SCI","Front.

Nine of them (Boraginales, Cucurbitales, Ericales, Lamiales, Laurales, Malvales, Santalales, Solanales, and Zygophyllales) are represented in Colombia by 17 families, 44 genera and 246 species, including facultative (37) and obligate (187) hemiparasites, holoexoparasites (19) and holoendoparasites (3). Cladocolea coriacea (Loranthaceae) is reported for the first time in Colombia. One genus (Sanguisuga, Cytinaceae) and 69 species (28.04%) are endemic to the country. Endemism decreases with elevation, ranging from 26 species (37.68%) below 1000 m, to one species (1.44%) above 4000 m. Speciation in Aetanthus, Psittacanthus and Tristerix (Loranthaceae), Dendrophthora and Phoradendron (Viscaceae), and Castilleja and Neobartsia (Orobanchaceae) was likely prompted by the Andean uplift. The highest number of species (169) are found in the Andean Region, whereas the Orinoco Region contains the lowest number (29). Dry forests and thickets, and coastal vegetation of the Caribbean Region are the preferred ecosystems for Krameria (Krameriaceae), Sanguisuga, Acanthosyris (Cervantesiaceae), Maracanthus (Loranthaceae), Ximenia (Ximeniaceae), Lennoa (Ehretiaceae), and Anisantherina (Orobanchaceae). Orobanche minor, recently introduced to the country, is the only potential weed for crops between 2500 and 3200 m in the Eastern Cordillera. Convergent lifeforms include: the obligate, twining stem holoparasitic Cassytha (Lauraceae) and Cuscuta (Convolvulaceae); the root holoexoparasitic Sanguisuga, Mitrastemon (Mitrastemonaceae), all Balanophoraceae, and Lennoa; and the root obligate hemiparasitic Krameria, Gaiadendron (Loranthaceae), and all Cervantesiaceae, Opiliaceae, Schoepfiaceae, Strombosiaceae and Ximeniaceae. Holoendoparasitism occurs only in Apodanthaceae, whereas root facultative hemiparasitism is restricted to the Orobanchaceae.","[Gonzalez, Favio] Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Nat, Sede Bogota, Bogota, Colombia; [Pabon-Mora, Natalia] Univ Antioquia, Inst Biol, Medellin, Colombia","Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Universidad de Antioquia","Pabón-Mora, N (corresponding author), Univ Antioquia, Inst Biol, Medellin, Colombia.","","","Pabon-Mora, Natalia/0000-0003-3528-8078","Evolucion de los genes asociados a embriogenesis temprana de la endoparasita Pilostyles boya-censis (Apodanthaceae); Facultad de Ciencias, Sede Bogota, Universidad Nacional de Colombia [50155, 202010026978]; Estrategia de Sostenibi-lidad","Evolucion de los genes asociados a embriogenesis temprana de la endoparasita Pilostyles boya-censis (Apodanthaceae); Facultad de Ciencias, Sede Bogota, Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Estrategia de Sostenibi-lidad","Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium This research was funded by the project Evolucion de los genes asociados a embriogenesis temprana de la endoparasita Pilostyles boya-censis (Apodanthaceae), funded by the Facultad de Ciencias, Sede Bogota, Universidad Nacional de Colombia (Codigo HERMES: 50155; Codigo QUIPU: 202010026978) and the Estrategia de Sostenibi-lidad 2018-2019 project granted to the Plant Evo-Devo group at the Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin (Colombia).",NA,"38","0","0","9","9","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0006-8101","1874-9372","","BOT REV","Bot.

The potential applications that this process has on wild species, which can be useful for restoration, are usually overlooked. This study analyses the germination response after natural priming and hydropriming of Penstemon roseus and Castilleja tenuiflora, two perennial herbs growing in a protected area known as Parque Ecologico de la Ciudad de Mexico'. Photoblastism was evaluated for both species. Seeds were exposed to a hydration/dehydration cycle and then placed in germination chambers to determine responses to hydropriming. To identify the effects of natural priming, seeds were buried in natural conditions and then recovered every two months and placed in germination chambers. Germination percentages and rates were then quantified. Both species proved to have permeable seed coats. Penstemon roseus seeds are positive photoblastic whereas C. tenuiflora seeds are indifferent to light. Priming methods increased C. tenuiflora germination rates, but they did not affect germination capacity. For P. roseus, priming methods did not improve germination rates, and germination capacity of recovered seeds decreased after the rainy season, suggesting that P. roseus forms a short-term, transient, seed bank. The germination strategies of these two species allow them to occupy suitable microsites for germination and establishment. These responses can be helpful in developing restoration programmes based on the accelerated establishment of native and characteristic successional species.","[Belmont, Jafet; Osuna-Fernandez, Helia R.; Pisanty, Irene] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Apartado Postal 70-275,Ciudad Univ, Coyoacan 04510, CdMx, Mexico; [Sanchez-Coronado, Maria E.; Orozco-Segovia, Alma] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Fisiol, Apartado Postal 70-275,Ciudad Univ, Coyoacan 04510, CdMx, Mexico","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","Pisanty, I (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Apartado Postal 70-275,Ciudad Univ, Coyoacan 04510, CdMx, Mexico.","ipisanty@unam.mx","","Belmont, Jafet/0000-0002-6879-4412","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [PAPIIT-IN201912, IN205715]","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico(Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico)","This research was financed by the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (projects PAPIIT-IN201912 and IN205715) and was developed in the workshop Taller de Ecologia Terrestre y Manejo de Recursos Bioticos, Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM.",NA,"35","2","2","1","15","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND","0960-2585","1475-2735","","SEED SCI RES","Seed Sci.

This imperfect detectability is rarely accounted for in the estimation of demographic parameters, such as survival probabilities (S) or transition rates between different life states or size classes (?), which may result in inaccurate quantitative information about plant populations. In this study, we used previously collected data of five plant species belonging to different families with contrasting life forms and habitats (Flaveria chlorifolia, Mammillaria hernandezii, Neobuxbaumia macrocephala, Govenia lagenophora, and Castilleja tenuiflora), data simulations, multi-state models (a demographic tool that explicitly accounts for p), and direct estimation of survival and transition rates (i.e., assuming perfect detection) to identify in which species, states, or demographic parameters the bias caused by ignoring our imperfect detectability is more severe. Detection was imperfect (p < 1) for all our study species. In general, ignoring detection probabilities yielded underestimated survival and transition rates in all five species. Biases caused by assuming perfect detection were also large and significant, mainly in inconspicuous life states and size classes, such as seedlings and dry individuals. In contrast, considering detection probabilities resulted in fewer underestimated survival and transition rates, with smaller and mostly nonsignificant biases. Intriguingly, some transitions were overestimated even when accounting for detection probabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of considering that detection of most plant species is imperfect in the field, even in species that are apparently conspicuous, to avoid incorrect inferences about plant populations.","[Martinez-Villegas, Jorge A.; Pisanty, Irene; Martorell, Carlos; Hernandez-Apolinar, Mariana; Valverde, Teresa; Granados-Hernandez, Luisa A.; Rodriguez-Sanchez, Mariana; Zuniga-Vega, J.

These cues can originate from tissues on the same plant or from different individuals. Since parasitic plants form vascular connections with their host, parasites have the potential to receive cues from hosts that allow them to adjust defenses against future herbivory. However, the role of plant communication between hosts and parasites for herbivore defense remains poorly investigated. Here, we examined the effects of damage to lupine hosts (Lupinus texensis) on responses of the attached hemiparasite (Castilleja indivisa), and indirectly, on a specialist herbivore of the parasite, buckeyes (Junonia coenia). Lupines produce alkaloids that act as defenses against herbivores that can be taken up by the parasite. We found that damage to lupine host plants by beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) significantly increased jasmonic acid (JA) levels in both the lupine host and parasite, suggesting uptake of phytohormones or priming of parasite defenses by using host cues. However, lupine host damage did not induce changes in alkaloid levels in the hosts or parasites. Interestingly, the parasite had substantially higher concentrations of JA and alkaloids compared to lupine host plants. Buckeye herbivores consumed more parasite tissue when attached to damaged compared to undamaged hosts. We hypothesize that increased JA due to lupine host damage induced higher iridoid glycosides in the parasite, which are feeding stimulants for this specialist herbivore. Our results demonstrate that damage to hosts may affect both parasites and associated herbivores, indicating cascading effects of host damage on multiple trophic levels.","[Tjiurutue, Muvari Connie; Adler, Lynn S.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, 221 Morrill Sci Ctr South,611 North Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Tjiurutue, Muvari Connie] Univ Namibia, Dept Chem & Biochem, 340 Mandume Ndemufayo Ave, Pionierspark, Windhoek, Namibia; [Stevenson, Philip C.] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Cent Ave, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England; [Stevenson, Philip C.] Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3AB, Surrey, England","University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Namibia; University of Greenwich; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew","Tjiurutue, MC (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, 221 Morrill Sci Ctr South,611 North Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Tjiurutue, MC (corresponding author), Univ Namibia, Dept Chem & Biochem, 340 Mandume Ndemufayo Ave, Pionierspark, Windhoek, Namibia.","connie.muv@gmail.com","Stevenson, Philip C/E-8822-2013; stevenson, philip c/E-8741-2013","Stevenson, Philip C/0000-0002-0736-3619; stevenson, philip c/0000-0002-0736-3619","Fulbright Fellowship; Faculty for the Future Fellowship; Plant Biology Graduate program; USDA/CSREES [MAS000411]; USDA NRI [2008-02,346]","Fulbright Fellowship; Faculty for the Future Fellowship; Plant Biology Graduate program; USDA/CSREES(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); USDA NRI(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","The study was funded by Fulbright Fellowship (MCT), Faculty for the Future Fellowship (MCT), Plant Biology Graduate program (MCT), USDA/CSREES (Hatch) MAS000411 (LSA) and USDA NRI 2008-02,346 (LSA).",NA,"42","1","1","1","38","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0098-0331","1573-1561","","J CHEM ECOL","J.

We asked whether the nurse shrub Hypericum laricifolium affected the colonization and activity of fungal symbionts of plants showing contrasting patterns of local spatial association with this nurse in four sites between 4100 and 4400 m in the tropical Andes. We selected three abundant herb species (Senecio wedglacialis, Castilleja fissifolia, and Agrostis tolucensis) which showed positive spatial associations with the shrub, and two herbs (Agrostis breviculmis and the exotic Rumex acetosella), which showed predominantly negative associations. We collected roots of these species from individuals under the shrub's crown and outside, and measured colonization and activity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and colonization of dark septate fungi (DSE), as well as glomalin content in soil samples from both study situations. We found no consistent effect of the nurse across species or elevations on the degree of AMF and DSE colonization, but there was a consistent increase in AMF phosphatase activity in plants positively associated with the shrub, as well as an increase in the content of easily extractable glomalin in soils under its influence across elevations. Thus, our results suggest that an increased AMF metabolic activity and soil stabilization mediated by the increase in extractable glomalin could be linked with an indirect facilitation effect of this nurse shrub on its beneficiary plants.","[Caceres-Mago, Karla; Caceres, Alicia] Univ Cent Venezuela, Fac Ciencias, Inst Biol Expt, Caracas, Venezuela; [Llambi, Luis D.] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Ecol, Merida 5101, Venezuela","University of Central Venezuela; University of Los Andes Venezuela","Cáceres-Mago, K (corresponding author), Univ Cent Venezuela, Fac Ciencias, Inst Biol Expt, Caracas, Venezuela.","kcaceresmago@gmail.com","","Caceres-Mago, Karla/0000-0003-3782-1489","","","",NA,"64","2","3","2","29","SPRINGER BASEL AG","BASEL","PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND","1664-2201","1664-221X","","ALPINE BOT","Alp.

Because animal-pollinated plants depend on sequential pollinator visits to conspecifics for successful reproduction, understanding the relationship between relative densities of co-flowering plants and bee visits within a foraging path is necessary to determine whether co-flowering species facilitate or compete for bee visitation. We examined the role of relative co-flowering plant species densities in determining bee visits to two focal plant species (Astragalus scaphoides and Penstemon albertinus) within foraging paths by following individual bees in natural multispecies co-flowering plant communities. We found that conspecific and heterospecific plant density influenced the proportion of visits to the focal plant species during foraging bouts, but effects of density differed among bee groups. Considering all bees, Lupinus spp. facilitated visits to A. scaphoides while Castilleja spp. competed with A. scaphoides for visits. When three bee groups, Bombus, Anthophora/Eucera, and small bees,'' were modeled separately, Bombus consistently visited A. scaphoides more than expected regardless of its density and P. albertinus less than expected at intermediate densities. Anthophora/Eucera exhibited a nonlinear response to A. scaphoides floral density but visited P. albertinus in direct proportion to its density. Small bees'' visited both plants in direct proportion to their densities.

Regional admixture provenancing, mixing seeds derived from multiple populations within the same region as the target site, has been suggested to produce genetically diverse germplasm. Yet little empirical evidence shows how genetic diversity in germplasm resulting from this approach compares to source populations, or how it varies in restored populations. Here, we use neutral molecular markers to follow genetic diversity through production and use of germplasm when mixing multiple source populations in nursery production beds. Castilleja levisecta is a rare species experiencing inbreeding depression in remaining populations, with a federal recovery plan requiring the re-establishment of populations in areas where it has been extirpated. Specifically, we track diversity from wild-collected source populations through different production approaches and reintroductions using two propagule types. We show that measures of genetic diversity, inbreeding, and relatedness change during the production and use of material produced with a regional admixture provenancing approach, with the step at which source populations are mixed and germplasm type used influencing whether all source populations are equally represented. While genetic diversity increased throughout the process, inbreeding and relatedness increased in nursery production beds but decreased in reintroductions, with the lowest inbreeding and relatedness in populations restored using seeds rather than plugs. The results highlight the importance of taking an integrated approach informed by research when planning and implementing reintroductions with mixed-source germplasm.","[St Clair, Adrienne Basey] Northwestern Univ, Program Plant Biol & Conservat, 2205 Tech Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [St Clair, Adrienne Basey; Fant, Jeremie B.; Kramer, Andrea T.] Negaunee Inst Plant Conservat Sci & Act, Bot Garden, 1000 Lake Cook Rd, Chicago, IL 60022 USA; [Dunwiddie, Peter W.] Univ Washington, Biol Dept, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kaye, Thomas N.] Inst Appl Ecol, 563 SW Jefferson Ave, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; [Kaye, Thomas N.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Northwestern University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Oregon State University","Kramer, AT (corresponding author), Negaunee Inst Plant Conservat Sci & Act, Bot Garden, 1000 Lake Cook Rd, Chicago, IL 60022 USA.","akramer@chicagobotanic.org","Kramer, Andrea T/K-8427-2017; Dunwiddie, Peter/Q-7709-2016","Fant, Jeremie/0000-0001-9276-1111; Dunwiddie, Peter/0000-0002-7254-0423; St. Clair, Adrienne/0000-0001-5621-2350","","","",NA,"80","31","34","3","24","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1061-2971","1526-100X","","RESTOR ECOL","Restor.

We examined the importance of pollination vs pre-dispersal seed predation to selection on plant and floral characters via female plant-reproductive success in Castilleja linariaefolia (Scrophulariaceae). C. linariaefolia is pollinated by hummingbirds and experiences high levels of pre-dispersal seed predation by plume moth and fly larvae in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA, where this work was conducted. We first examined whether female reproduction in C. linariaefolia was limited by pollination. Supplemental pollination only marginally increased components of female reproduction, likely because seed predation masked, in part, the beneficial effects of pollen addition. In unmanipulated populations, we measured calyx length, flower production, and plant height and used path analysis combined with structural equation modeling to quantify their importance to relative seed set through pathways involving pollination vs seed predation. We found that the strength of selection on calyx length, flower production, and plant height was greater for seed predation pathways than for pollination pathways, and one character, calyx length, experienced opposing selection via pollination vs seed predation. These results suggest that the remarkable intraspecific variation in plant and floral characters exhibited by some flowering plants is likely the result of selection driven, at least in part, by pollinators in concert with antagonists, such as pre-dispersal seed predators. This work highlights the subtle but complex interactions that shape floral and vegetative design in natural ecosystems.","Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","","Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA.","rirwin@arches.uga.edu","Cariveau, Daniel/AAB-9336-2020","","","","",NA,"72","152","178","3","111","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0030-1299","1600-0706","","OIKOS","Oikos","JAN","2004","104","1",NA,"","","","15","26","","10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12641.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12641.x","","","12","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","762FY",NA,"",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000187962200002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Non-native plants may be more successful than natives in disturbed areas and thus be able to respond quicker to shifting climatic zones. In 2009, monitoring plots were established for populations of a non-native species (Linaria dalmatica) and a closely related native species (Castilleja miniata) on an elevation gradient in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, USA. Population data were collected twice during the growing season for 3 years and used to calculate population vital rates for both species, and to construct population dynamics models for L. dalmatica. Linaria dalmatica vital rates were more associated with climatic/environmental factors than those of C. miniata. Population dynamics models for L. dalmatica showed no trend in population growth rate (lambda) vs. elevation. The highest lambda corresponded with the lowest vegetation and litter cover, and the highest bare ground cover. All populations with lambda < 1 corresponded with the lowest measured winter minimum temperature. There was a negative association between lambda and number of weeks of adequate soil moisture, and a weak positive association between lambda and mean winter minimum temperature. Variance in vital rates and lambda of L. dalmatica suggest broad adaptation within its current range, with the potential to spread further with or without future changes in climate. There is evidence that lambda is negatively affected by persistent soil moisture which promotes the growth of other plant species, suggesting that it might expand further if other species were removed by disturbance.","[Pollnac, Fredric W.; Maxwell, Bruce D.; Rew, Lisa J.] Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Taper, Mark L.] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Taper, Mark L.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL USA","Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Pollnac, FW (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Leon Johnson Hall, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.","fwpollnac@gmail.com","","","Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program [RC 1545]; NRI [2009-55320-05033]; NSF [0440594]; MIREN consortium; MSU Weed and Invasive Plant Ecology and Management group; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education [0440594] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program; NRI; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); MIREN consortium; MSU Weed and Invasive Plant Ecology and Management group; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU))","We would like to thank the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (project RC 1545), NRI 2009-55320-05033, and NSF (GK-12 Grant # 0440594) for providing funding for this project.

The effect was investigated of variable food density on territory area and time budgeting by controlled removals and additions of flowers of Castilleja linariaefolia within the territories of immature birds. The experiments were replicated 3 times with generally consistent results. Within 1 day following a 50% decrease in flower density: territory area usually almost doubled, resulting in the number of defended flowers remaining similar to the premanipulation value; foraging time increased significantly from .apprx. 21-26% of the day as a result of a significant increase in foraging bout duration, with bout frequency remaining unchanged; daily sitting time decreased significantly from .apprx. 76-71% of the day; and daily defense time did not change significantly at about 3% of the day. These patterns reversed within 1 day following subsequent experimental increases in flower density. Migrant hummingbirds are energy maximizers that gain weight as rapidly as possible while on their territories. By modifying a simple model of feeding-territory area for such foragers (Hixo 1980) to incorporate previously described aspects of hummingbird foraging, a priori predictions of changes in territory area and time budgeting were generated. The direction of these predictions were independently corroborated by the experimental results. Refining a single factor of the model using the field data produced quantitative a posteriori predictions that very closely approached the experimental results in magnitude and direction. In response to short-term variations in food availability, migrant hummingbirds are capable of adjusting territory size and time budgeting in a manner consistent with maximizing daily net energy gain.","","","UNIV CALIF IRVINE, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, IRVINE, CA 92717 USA.","","","","","","",NA,"83","159","178","0","25","UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","CHICAGO","1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","0003-0147","1537-5323","","AM NAT","Am.

This study explores whether geographic variation in pollinator interactions underlies the observed patterns of floral divergence both 1) among species of the Castilleja purpurea complex (C. purpurea, C. citrina and C. lindheimeri) and the congener C. sessiliflora, as well as 2) within C. sessiliflora, across its wide geographic range. We sampled floral visitors and floral traits (morphology and color) at 23 populations across a 1900 km-wide study area in 1-3 years, with reproductive fitness (fruit set) data for 18 of these populations. A wide diversity of pollinator functional groups visited the focal species, including bees, butterflies, hawkmoths and hummingbirds, and visitor assemblages varied among species and across geography. We identified relationships between floral traits and visitation by certain pollinator groups, which often aligned with predictions based on pollination syndromes. Despite visitor assemblages being largely generalized across most populations, we found that the observed changes in floral traits were associated with shifts in the relative frequencies of key pollinator functional groups. Hence this study demonstrates that variation in pollinator assemblages across the distributions of taxa may underlie divergence in floral traits and suggests that highly specialized relationships may not be required for early stages of pollinator-mediated floral divergence. Our extensive sampling of 23 populations over multiple years across a large geographic area highlights the value of range-wide studies for characterizing patterns of divergence mediated by ecological interactions.","[Wenzell, Katherine E.] John Innes Ctr, Colney Lane, Norwich, England; [Wenzell, Katherine E.; Skogen, Krissa A.; Fant, Jeremie B.] Northwestern Univ, Program Plant Biol & Conservat, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Wenzell, Katherine E.; Skogen, Krissa A.; Fant, Jeremie B.] Negaunee Inst Plant Conservat Sci & Act, Chicago Bot Garden, Glencoe, IL 60035 USA; [Skogen, Krissa A.] Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clemson, SC USA","UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); John Innes Center; Northwestern University; Clemson University","Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), John Innes Ctr, Colney Lane, Norwich, England.;Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Program Plant Biol & Conservat, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Wenzell, KE (corresponding author), Negaunee Inst Plant Conservat Sci & Act, Chicago Bot Garden, Glencoe, IL 60035 USA.","kewenzell@gmail.com","","Fant, Jeremie/0000-0001-9276-1111; Skogen, Krissa/0000-0002-7868-9632; Wenzell, Katherine/0000-0002-1635-5485","Botanical Society of America; American Society of Plant Taxonomists; American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant; Friends of Nachusa Grasslands; Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1842165]; NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates site award [DBI-461007, DBI-1757800]; Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation and Action at the Chicago Botanic Garden","Botanical Society of America; American Society of Plant Taxonomists; American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant; Friends of Nachusa Grasslands; Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates site award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation and Action at the Chicago Botanic Garden","Funding was provided by the Botanical Society of America, American Society of Plant Taxonomists, American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Grant, Friends of Nachusa Grasslands, Northwestern University Program in Plant Biology and Conservation and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship award (DGE-1842165) to KEW.

Using a plant-pollinator system as a model, I tested the prediction the presence of a competitor for pollination influences the strength and/or direction of pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits. I measured phenotypic selection via female fitness on five floral traits of Ipomopsis aggregata in seven populations. Four contained only conspecifics (I only) and three also contained the competitor Castilleja linariaefolia (C + I). Directional selection via fruits/plant and conspecific pollen deposited/flower on corolla length was positive and significantly stronger in C + I populations. This difference in selection was apparently driven by interpopulation variation in the degree to which reproduction of I. aggregata was pollen limited. Consistent with expectations of interspecific competition, I. aggregata plants in C + I populations received less conspecific pollen per flower and set fewer seeds per fruit and fruits per plant than those in I only populations. Ipomopsis aggregata's corollas were also significantly longer in C + I populations, suggesting that there had been a response to a similar selective regime in past generations. Phenotypic correlations between corolla length and width, which determine the variation in I. aggregata's flower shape, were significantly weaker in C + I populations. These data suggest that competition for pollination can influence the strength of selection on and patterns of correlations among floral traits of I. aggregata. If I. aggregata populations with and without competitors for pollination are linked by gene flow, then measuring selection in competitive and noncompetitive environments maybe necessary to accurately predict how floral traits will evolve.","Univ Illinois, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, Shelford Vivarium, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Lab, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Caruso, CM (corresponding author), Grinnell Coll, Dept Biol, POB 805, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA.","","","Caruso, Christina/0000-0001-7069-9572","","","",NA,"72","165","190","6","71","SOC STUDY EVOLUTION","LAWRENCE","810 E 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA","0014-3820","","","EVOLUTION","Evolution","OCT","2000","54","5",NA,"","","","1546","1557","","","","","","12","Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity","376RR","11108583","",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000165471000008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Over 28 months from 1977 to 1979, bighorn diet consisted of 79 species, including 14 grasses, 47 forbs and bryophytes, plus 18 trees and shrubs. Grasses, forbs, and shrubs comprised 66.6, 18.9, and 14.5% of the diet, respectively. Three years of bighorn sheep grazing reduced (P < 0.05) leaf and culm lengths of bluebunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum (Pursh) Scribn. & Smith). Grazing generally reduced leaf length, basal diameter, culm (stem) length, and culm (stem) numbers of prairie Junegrass (Koeleria cristata Pers.), Sandberg's bluegrass (Poa sandbergii Vasey), needle-and-thread (Stipa comata Trin. & Rupr.), Thompson's paintbrush (Castilleja thompsonii Pennell), silky lupine (Lupinus sericeus Pursh), and snow buckwheat (Eriogonum niveum Dougl.). Vigor of arrowleaf balsamroot (Balsamorhiza sagittata (Pursh) Nutt.) was unaffected by grazing, despite its dietary importance. Total plant frequency remained unchanged between 1976 and 1983 in areas grazed by bighorn sheep, and in grazing exclosures. Total grass frequency declined from 46.5 to 30.8% within the exclosures, but increased from 44.7 to 48.8% in response to bighorn sheep grazing. Forb frequency remained unchanged after 7 years of bighorn sheep grazing while frequency of yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.) increased more inside exclosures than on the grazed area. Botanical composition of shrubs increased on grazed and ungrazed areas from 1976 to 1983, but frequency was unaffected by bighorn sheep grazing.

There are at least 3 mechanisms. First, some individuals behave as generalists themselves, and have almost equal likelihoods of depositing their eggs on different host species. Second, the population contains insects with different distinct preferences. This variation in preference affects variation in host use. Third, one of the most highly preferred hosts is sufficiently rare and localized that most insects which do prefer it search without finding it until other, less preferred hosts become acceptable. They then oviposit on these secondarily preferred species. The degree of host specialization (specificity) is a continuous variable in this population. While some butterflies show neutral preference and fail to discriminate between potential host species, others are just as host-specific as individuals in strictly monophagous populations (of some species). In such monophagous population there is no variation of preference rank order and no undiscriminating insects (with neutral preference) have been found. The distribution and abundance of potential hosts does not usually affect breadth of host use by the population. Evidence to date indicates that heritability of intrapopulation variation in preference is likely to be low, but that larval conditioning is not involved. If adult conditioning occurs, it is not duplicated by captive insects. There has been selection favoring the use of 1 of the 4 host species [Pedicularis semibarbata, Collinsia torreyi, Castilleja applegatei and Mimulus whitneyi] in at least 2 of the 3 yr of this study. This species has recently undergone a change in quality.

In other words, the parasitic organs (haustoria) which both structurally and physiologically join host and parasite are remarkable instances of convergent evolution in these different groups. The main thread which can be followed throughout the many anatomical studies which in the past were carried out on haustoria is the search for common denominators between various groups; that is, as to how much the haustoria of unrelated taxa have come to resemble each other. When Solms-Laubach (1867-1868) more than a century ago reviewed the structure of angiosperm haustoria it required well over 100 pages to do so. Needless to say the bulk of our present knowledge was obtained since that time, and light microscopy continues to unearth significant new information. In a recent review of haustorial anatomy (Kuijt, 1969), several structural parallelisms are noted. The advent of EM has, since the latter review, resulted in a great deal of additional information which has enabled certain comparisons between groups to be made. Ultrastructural studies have quite naturally concentrated on the most readily available which, of course, are also those which were most intensively studied with the light microscope in the past. The haustoria of several families, such as Rafflesiaceae, Balanophoraceae, Hydnoraceae, and Lennoaceae, were scarcely studied even with the light microscope. A general review of present knownledge of the ultrastructure of haustoria is presented. Most recent purely anatomical work was ignored, except where relevant to the topics under discussion. Ultrastructural observations were made on mistletoes (Arceuthobium and Phthirusa, Loranthaceae), Santalaceae (several genera), Scrophulariaceae (Castilleja), Orobanchaceae (Orobanche) and Convolvulaceae (Cuscuta), in which order the discussion will proceed.","UNIV LETHBRIDGE, DEPT BIOL SCI, LETHBRIDGE, ALBERTA, CANADA","University of Lethbridge","","","","","","","",NA,"44","61","64","0","12","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0305-7364","1095-8290","","ANN BOT-LONDON","Ann.

The present practice insight derives from land manager requests to document current on-site activity and provides a management planning reference for restoration on Violet Prairie. Start-up restoration initiates from trial-and- -error adaptive management practices in the Puget Sound region of western Washington, USA. Treatments used focus on the implementation of staged-scale restoration. Preparation intends to meet reintroduction goals of establishing a native plant community that could potentially support the threatened endemic Castilleja levisecta ( golden paintbrush). Reintroduction of the associated native plant community provides habitat for endangered Euphydryas editha taylori (Taylor's checkerspot butterfly). 2. Known conventional agricultural use coupled to fire suppression since the 1800s altered regional prairie lands to an unfavourable state for native plant species. Local native prairie soil types were favoured for growing conventional grasses and exotic forb species common to grazing pastures. Land abandonment and degradation has lengthened the time of disturbance and complicated restoring to a generalized reference point prior to settlement. Persistent exotic species, encroaching housing development, coniferous forest and recent wildfire complicate converting back to native prairie. 3. Threatened and endangered species and their habitat are targeted in a trial-and-error process of staged-scale adaptive management within the goal of whole ecosystem and connectivity restoration. Land managers focus on exotics removal and intensive native reseeding while restoring the use of prescribed burning as a maintenance tool. Embedded monitoring and observation advises where future practices need to be adapted by focusing on treatments and outcomes. 4. Past land use practices replaced native soil seed banks with exotic seed banks that further distort reference proxies. Unknowns interrupt the current implementation additionally to soil conversion issues, while short-term adaptive management methods initiate conversion back to native prairie. Species reintroduction choices to develop community structure are complicated by the fact that historical reference point species may be missing altogether from existing native communities. An unanswered outcome of the restoration process is determining which set of treatments best prepares soil for the desired native plant community.","[Muzychko, Claudia G.

Unfortunately. botanical inventories are less common for reservations than other land jurisdictions. Such ecological importance and needs are apparent for the Wind River Indian Reservation (WRIR), the 7th largest reservation in the US (>890,000 ha) that is shared by the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho. Material and methods - A botanical study for two WRIR high-elevation basins (Saint Lawrence Basin (SLB) and Paradise Basin (PB)) to (1) reconcile a 1960 plant list, and (2) quantify plant communities ecologically was conducted. In 2017, 106 monitoring sites were established to quantify species presence. Across basins, 231 total vascular plant taxa (221 to species and 10 to genus) were identified, or > 3x more plant species than noted in the 1960 list. In SLB, 222 plant taxa (213 to species and 9 to genus) were identified and in PB 98 plant taxa (90 to species and 8 to genus) were identified. In 2018, sites were re-sampled to quantify species abundance, soil pH. organic matter. soil nutrients, CEC. salts, and texture. Key results - Slope and elevation explained species distributions in the topography ordination and soil organic matter, pH, texture, P, and K explained species distributions in the soil ordination. Eleven exotic species, and one rare endemic species were documented with implications for empowering tribal management. Using a classification approach followed by an indicator species analysis and fidelity (Phi) assessment, we identified 14 unique plant communities and related these to 6 alliances and 7 associations across 6 macrogroups from the US National Vegetation Classification database. These indicator species of communities included sedges (Carex aquatilus), grasses (Pseudoroegneria spicata, Elymus elymoides, Achnatherum lettermanii, Elymus trachycaulus subsp. trachycaulus, Poa glauca subsp. rupicola), forbs (Polygonum bistortoides, Balsamorhiza incana, Castilleja flava), shrubs (Artemisia tridentata, Betula glandulosa, Dasiphora fruticosa subsp. floribunda) and trees (Pinus contorta). Conclusion - The plant taxa, plant communities, and ecological drivers documented in this study will enhance tribal and federal monitoring of these high-elevation WRIR basins.","[Friday, Colleen; Scasta, John Derek] Univ Wyoming, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","University of Wyoming","Scasta, JD (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.","jscasta@uwyo.edu","","","Bureau of Indian Affairs [A17AC00019]","Bureau of Indian Affairs","Funding was provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs - Grant/Cooperative Agreement Number A17AC00019 Enhanced Ecological Inventory of High Elevation Basins on the Wind River Indian Reservation.

Thus, control of PME activity is critical for enhancing our understanding of plant physiological processes and regulation. Here, we report on the identification of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a green tea component, as a natural inhibitor for pectin methyl esterases. In a gel assay for PME activity, EGCG blocked esterase activity of pure PME as well as PME extracts from citrus and from parasitic plants. Fluorometric tests were used to determine the IC50 for a synthetic substrate. Molecular docking analysis of PME and EGCG suggests close interaction of EGCG with the catalytic cleft of PME. Inhibition of PME by the green tea compound, EGCG, provides the means to study the diverse roles of PMEs in cell wall metabolism and plant development. In addition, this study introduces the use of EGCG as natural product to be used in the food industry and agriculture. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Field surveys were conducted in nine alpine sites across four of the highest volcanoes in central Mexico for three years to document hummingbird occurrence, habitat use, and some aspects of behavior. We also searched through historical museum collections and online databases to document early records of hummingbirds in Mexican alpine habitats. In addition, we conducted a search through historical herbarium collections of ornithophilous plant species in alpine habitats, and a literature search on glacier retreats in Mexico to establish past and present elevational limits of alpine vegetation. We recorded the presence of four hummingbird species using floral resources across the nine study sites: Cynanthus latirostris (Broad-billed Hummingbird), Hylocharis leucotis (White-eared Hummingbird), Lampornis clemenciae (Blue-throated Hummingbird), and Selasphorus platycercus (Broad-tailed Hummingbird). The latter two species were recorded frequently throughout the growing season (May-October), whereas C. latirostris was observed on one day in July, and H. leucotis on two days in April and May. Three of the four species were observed foraging from Castilleja tolucensis, an alpine Mexican endemic herb, at 4428 m above sea level, and all four species foraged from Penstemon gentianoides at the lower alpine sites 390(M 100. At the highest elevations, we observed hummingbirds hovering and perching on rocks while feeding from flowers at ground level. Both male and female of L. clemenciae and S. platycercus were present at patches of P. gentianoides; however, with S. platycercus, males accounted for more than 80% of the individuals observed and more than 95% of individuals observed at the highest elevations. Additionally, a survey of historical records from museum collections and bird sightings from e-databases revealed only three early records of hummingbirds in alpine sites, with only one observed earlier than 1987. This suggests that hummingbirds were not recorded earlier in alpine habitats because of a lack of sampling. Nevertheless, evidence from glacial retreats and plant distributions along an elevational gradient also indicate that hummingbirds have expanded their elevational range as new habitats have opened up for colonization associated with global climate change. The results reported here are the first records of the our hummingbird species in the Mexican alpine grassland and one of the highest altitudinal records for hummingbirds in North America. We discuss the importance and conservation implications of alpine ecosystems in Mexico as habitats for hummingbirds.","[Arredondo-Amezcua, Libertad] Inst Ecol AC, Ctr Reg Bajio, Xalapa Enriquez, Veracruz, Mexico; [Marten-Rodriguez, Silvana; Ramirez-Aguirre, Erandi; Quesada, Mauricio] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Escuela Nacl Estudios Super, Unidad Morelia, Lab Nacl Anal & Sintesis Ecol, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico; [Lopezaraiza-Mikel, Martha; Sayago-Lorenzana, Roberto] Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Fac Desarrollo Sustentable, Chilpancingo, Guerrero, Mexico; [del Coro-Arizmendi, Maria] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico; [Quesada, Mauricio] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecol Sustentabilidad, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico","Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","Martén-Rodríguez, S (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Escuela Nacl Estudios Super, Unidad Morelia, Lab Nacl Anal & Sintesis Ecol, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico.","smartenr@gmail.com","Ramirez-Aguirre, Erandi/E-9288-2011; MARTEN-RODRIGUEZ, SILVANA/E-1574-2015","MARTEN-RODRIGUEZ, SILVANA/0000-0003-1810-4759; RamirezAguirre, Erandi/0000-0002-5290-4517","Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [PAPIIT IV IV200418, IA208416, IA207618]; CONACyT-Mexico (Project: Laboratorio Nacional de Analisis y Sintesis Ecologica) [271449, 280505, 293701]; CONACyT-Mexico (Project: Sagarpa-CONACyT) [291333]; CONACyT-Mexico (Project: Repositorio Institucional) [271432]; CONACyT-Mexico (Project: SEP-CONACyT) [P250996]; CONACyT-Mexico [168433/168433]","Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; CONACyT-Mexico (Project: Laboratorio Nacional de Analisis y Sintesis Ecologica); CONACyT-Mexico (Project: Sagarpa-CONACyT); CONACyT-Mexico (Project: Repositorio Institucional); CONACyT-Mexico (Project: SEP-CONACyT); CONACyT-Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))","We thank the staff of Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl Zoquiapan and La Malinche National Parks, and Dr. Victor Steinmann for their support during the development of this research, as well as Dr. Patricia Escalante Pliego for providing access to the database of the National Collection of Birds.

In 1995 it was included in the UNESCO World Heritage site Virgin Komi Forests. Due to its large area (about 20 000 km(2)) and remoteness, the flora of the Yugyd va National Park still remains insufficiently studied. Systematic studies of its natural complexes have been carried out since 2005. This paper presents data on the composition and distribution of rare and protected species of vascular plants listed in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation, Red Data Book of the Republic of Komi and Appendices to them in the Yugyd va National Park. We found 120 species of rare and protected vascular plants in the Yugyd va National Park. We recorded 31 taxa listed in the Appendix of the Red Data Book of the Republic of Komi. Among them, there are endemics of the Arctic, Urals, North-East of European Russia, as well as Pleistocene relicts. A high number of plant populations are located on the border of species' ranges or their isolated fragments. Yugyd va National Park provides a territorial protection for nine species included in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation and its Appendix. The Protected Area plays an important role in preservation of plant populations of the narrow-ranged Arctic endemics Astragalus gorodkovii and Castilleja arctica subsp. vorkutensis. More than a third of all the rare species known in the Yugyd va National Park are under protection in the adjacent Russian regions of the Urals and the North-East of European Russia. In the Republic of Komi, Erysimum pallasii, Kobresia myosuroides, Drauba pauciflora, Achoriphragma nudicaule, Petasites sibiricus, Carex atrofusca, C. williamsii, C. krausei, C. misandra, Gastrolychnis affinis, Oxytropis merlensiana are known exclusively in the Yugyd va National Park. In the mountainous area of its northern part (Kozhim River basin), there are unique locations of Neotorularia humilis and Oxygraphis glacialis for Europe, and an unique location of Kobresia sinipliciuscula for the Republic of Komi. These species could be lost due to the planned exclusion of the Kozhimsky mining site from the area of the Yugyd va National Park. As additional measures to preserve the biological and genetic diversity of a number of particularly the most threatened taxa, it is necessary to develop species conservation programmes, monitor and restore populations, as well as to create a seed bank, and introduce these species to culture.","[Teteryuk, Liudmila, V; Degteva, Svetlana, V; Kanev, Vladimir A.; Valuyskikh, Olga E.; Teteryuk, Boris Yu; Kulyugina, Ekaterina E.] RAS, Inst Biol, Komi Sci Ctr, Ural Branch, Syktyvkar, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Biology, Komi Scientific Centre, Ural Branch RAS; Komi Science Centre of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences","Teteryuk, LV (corresponding author), RAS, Inst Biol, Komi Sci Ctr, Ural Branch, Syktyvkar, Russia.","teteryuk@ib.komisc.ru","Valuyskikh, Olga/AAF-3409-2019; Teteryuk, Liudmila V/Q-1961-2015","Teteryuk, Lyudmila/0000-0002-9573-7923; Kulyugina, Ekaterina/0000-0001-5097-1372; Kanev, Vladimir/0000-0002-6284-0385; Valuyskikh, Olga/0000-0003-2359-1731","","","",NA,"80","2","4","0","8","SARANSK FOND PODDERZKI & RAZVITIA ZAPOVEDNYH","SARANSK","SUMMER LANE, BUILDING 4,, SARANSK, REPUBLIC OF MORDOVIA 430007, RUSSIA","2500-008X","","","NAT CONSERV RES","Nat.

These aspects influence social relations, life strategies, and cultural identity, and all of them in turn influence and are influenced by local and regional patterns of interchange. In this study, we analyze the interchange of wild and weedy plants and mushrooms in traditional markets of the Phurepecha region of Mexico. Particularly, the social relations constructed around the interchange of these products; how knowledge, cultural values, and ecological factors influence and are influenced by interchange; and how all these factors influence the type and intensity of biotic resources management. Methods: We studied three main traditional markets of the Phurepecha region of Michoacan, Mexico, through 140 visits to markets and 60 semi-structured interviews to sellers of wild and weedy plants and mushrooms. In nearly 2 years, we carried out 80 visits and 30 interviews in the Barter Market, 20 visits and 15 interviews in the Phurepecha Tianguis, and 40 visits and 15 interviews to the Municipal Market. We documented information about the spaces of interchange that form the markets, the types of interchange occurring there, the cultural and economic values of the resources studied, the environmental units that are sources of such resources, the activities associated to resources harvesting and, particularly, the management techniques practiced to ensure or increase their availability. We analyzed the relations between the amounts of products interchanged, considered as pressures on the resources; the perception of their abundance or scarcity, considered as the magnitude of risk in relation to the pressures referred to; and the management types as response to pressures and risk. Results: We recorded 38 species of wild and weedy plants and 15 mushroom species interchanged in the markets. We characterized the spaces of interchange, the interchange types, and social relations among numerous Phurepecha communities which maintain the main features of pre-Columbian markets. The products analyzed are differentially valued according to their role in people's life, particularly food, medicine, rituals, and ornamental purposes. The highest cultural values were identified in multi-purpose plant and mushroom resources and, outstandingly, in ornamental and ritual plants. In markets, women are the main actors and connectors of the regional households' activities of use and management of local resources and ecosystems. The interrelationships between worldviews, knowledge, and practices are visible through the interchange of the products analyzed, including the types of environments comprised in communitarian territories, agricultural calendars, and feasts. Those plants and mushrooms are highly valued but relatively scarce according to the demand on them receiving special attention and management practices directed to ensure or increase their availability. With the exception of most mushrooms and ornamental and ritual plants, which have high economic and cultural values, there are those that are relatively scarce and under high risk, but are obtained through simple gathering from the wild. Conclusions: Traditional markets are crucial part of the subsistence strategy of Phurepecha people based on the multiple use of resources and ecosystems at the local and regional levels. The markets influence social relations, cultural identity, and preservation of traditional knowledge and biodiversity. In general, the demand of products in markets enhances innovation and practices for ensuring or increasing their availability, particularly those that are naturally scarce. However, it was notorious that, althoug mushrooms and ritual plants have high demand and value in markets, most of them are obtained by simple gathering.","[Farfan-Heredia, Berenice] Univ Intercultural Indigena Michoacan, Finca La Tsipecua Kilometro 3 Carretera, Patzcuaro Huecorio 61614, Michoacan, Mexico; [Farfan-Heredia, Berenice; Casas, Alejandro; Garcia-Frapolli, Eduardo] UNAM, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8711, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico; [Moreno-Calles, Ana I.] UNAM, Escuela Nacl Estudios Super, Unidad Morelia, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico; [Castilleja, Aida] Inst Nacl Antropol & Hist, Insurgentes Sur 421, Mexico City 06100, DF, Mexico","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","Casas, A (corresponding author), UNAM, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8711, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico.","acasas@cieco.unam.mx","Calles, Ana Isabel Moreno/L-6757-2017","Farfan-Heredia, Berenice/0000-0002-7953-3242","Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT, Mexico) [CB-2013-01-221800]; PAPIIT, UNAM [IN209214]","Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT, Mexico)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); PAPIIT, UNAM(Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico)","The authors thank the Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) for supporting PhD studies for the first author.

We also provide evidence from direct infusion electrospray mass spectrometry (DIEMS) that quandong fruit from trees growing near Melia azedarach (L.) contain an insecticidal compound.

Understanding the spatial organization of cell types is, therefore, of great importance in elucidating the functions of haustoria. Here, we report a three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of haustoria from two Orobanchaceae species, the obligate parasite Striga hermonthica infecting rice (Oryza sativa) and the facultative parasite Phtheirospermum japonicum infecting Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In addition, field-emission scanning electron microscopy observation revealed the presence of various cell types in haustoria. Our images reveal the spatial arrangements of multiple cell types inside haustoria and their interaction with host roots.

We studied the induction of IF-10 from nonadherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by IFN-gamma, interleukin-12 (IL-12), and the HER-2 peptide E75, which forms a CTL-defined antigen. We found that IFN-gamma alone was a weak inducer of IF-10 in these cells, whereas IL-12 was a significantly stronger inducer of IP-10, In the presence of IL-12, the tumor peptide E75 (HER-2, 369-377) was a stronger inducer of IF-10 than was IL-12 alone. E75 and its variants mutated at position 5 could also induce IF-10 in the absence of exogenous IL-12 or IFN-gamma, IP-10 induction by E75 required HLA-A2 presentation and B7-CD28 interactions and was partially inhibited by blocking of CD40-CD40L interactions. These results indicate that presentation of tumor peptides to peripheral T cells can induce a fast chemokine response, which in its early phase may be higher than the IFN-gamma response. This shows that the IF-10 response was independent of any early-phase IFN-gamma response in peripheral T cells. This may be important for understanding the regulation of the balance between chemoattractant chemokines (CC) and CXC chemokines by tumor Ag and may have implications for understanding the mechanisms of polarization of T cells and conditioning of antigen-presenting cells (APC) by tumor antigens.","Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Gynecol Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Bioimmunotherapy, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Surg, Bethesda, MD 20314 USA","University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences - USA","Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Gynecol Oncol, 1515 Holcombe Blvd,Room T 3881, Houston, TX 77030 USA.","cioannid@mail.mdanderson.org","Kim, Kyung Sik/I-5501-2015","","NCI NIH HHS [CA-16672] Funding Source: Medline","NCI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI))","",NA,"41","10","13","0","0","MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC","NEW ROCHELLE","140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA","1079-9907","1557-7465","","J INTERF CYTOK RES","J.

Significant proliferation and expansion of T cells was observed in 23 of 30 distinct samples. TIL were isolated from primary tumors by either enzymatic digestion or mechanical disruption, The TIL cultures were initiated using OKT3 mAb in the presence of moderate concentrations (25-50 U/ml) of IL-2, followed by 100 U/ml of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. TAL were not stimulated with OKT3 mAb, but all were successfully expanded in culture in the presence of IL-2 alone or together with TNF-alpha. Seven of nine distinct TAL grew in culture as predominantly CD4(+) lines. In contrast, only 14 of 21 (66%) of primary breast TIL expanded in culture and were predominantly of CD8(+) phenotype. Autologous tumor lysis was observed in seven of eight cases tested. Only one of the four TIL tested and one of the four TAL tested preferentially lysed autologous tumor. HER-2 peptide E75 (369-377) was recognized by two TIL lines of the five primary TIL tested and three of the four TAL tested. This suggests that E75 may be recognized by primary breast tumors.

To investigate potential differences in the local cellular immune response between breast cancer patients with and without nodal metastases, lymphocytes were isolated from axillary lymph nodes from patients with breast cancer, and proliferative and cytokine responses to HER-2/neu peptides were determined. Freshly isolated lymphocytes from lymph nodes of 7 women undergoing surgery for invasive breast cancer were plated at 20 X 10(5) cells per well in triplicate. Cells were stimulated with HER-2/neu peptides at 50 mug/ml and with control antigens. Incorporation of tritium-labeled thymidine was determined 4 days later. The levels of the cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and IL-10 were determined at priming and at restimulation with HER-2/neu peptides using a cytokine-specific, double-sandwich, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Lymphocytes isolated from the axillary lymph nodes of the patients mounted significant cellular immune response to HER-2/neu peptides, manifested by proliferation and specific cytokine elaboration. Proliferative responses to HER-2/neu peptides were seen in lymphocytes of patients with and without overexpression of HER-2/neu in the primary tumor. In some patients, the proliferative response to HER-2/neu peptides in lymphocytes from lymph nodes with metastases was absent or blunted compared with the response in lymphocytes from lymph nodes without metastases from the same patient (p < 0.05). HER-2/neu peptides induced a predominantly T helper type 1 (Th1) pattern of cytokine response in nodal lymphocytes isolated from breast cancer patients. A Th1-specific cytokine production pattern was maintained at priming and restimulation with HER-2/neu peptides and was amplified with IL-12 costimulation. These results indicate that HER-2/neu peptides can activate T cells in draining lymph nodes from women with invasive breast cancer. This activation is associated with a predominantly Th1 cytokine response, which suggests that conditioning with HER-2/neu peptides may be of value in the development of breast cancer vaccines.","Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Surg Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Breast Med Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Bioimmunotherapy, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Gynecol Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center","Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Surg Oncol, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.","hkuerer@mdanderson.org","","","NCI NIH HHS [CA16662] Funding Source: Medline","NCI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI))","",NA,"23","22","22","0","1","MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC","NEW ROCHELLE","140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA","1079-9907","1557-7465","","J INTERF CYTOK RES","J.

If parasitic plants acquired the full spectrum of secondary compounds from their host, one would expect a correlation between host and parasite palatability. We examined the palatability of leaves of the root-hemiparasite Melampyrum arvense grown with different host plants and the palatability of these host plants for two generalist herbivores, the caterpillar of Spodoptera littoralis and the slug Arion hisitanicus. We used 19 species of host plants from 11 families that are known to contain a wide spectrum of anti-herbivore compounds. Growth of M. arvense was strongly influenced by the host species. The palatability of the individual host species for the two herbivores differed strongly. Both A. lusitanicus and S. littoralis discriminated also, between hemiparasites grown with different host plants. There was no correlation between the palatability of a host species and that of the parasites grown on that host ,i.e., hemiparasites grown on palatable host species were not more palatable than those grown on unpalatable hosts. We suggest an interacting pattern of specific effects of chemical anti-herbivore defences and indirect effects of the hosts on herbivores through effects on growth and tissue quality of the parasites.","Univ Marburg, Dept Plant Ecol, Fac Biol, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; Univ Marburg, Dept Anim Ecol, Fac Biol, D-35032 Marburg, Germany","Philipps University Marburg; Philipps University Marburg","Univ Marburg, Dept Plant Ecol, Fac Biol, Karl von Frisch Str, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.","matthies@staff.uni-marburg.de","Schädler, Martin/A-9194-2008; Schädler, Martin/H-3176-2011","Schädler, Martin/0000-0001-9700-0311; Schädler, Martin/0000-0001-9700-0311; Matthies, Diethart/0000-0003-2439-0501","","","",NA,"58","21","23","0","28","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0029-8549","1432-1939","","OECOLOGIA","Oecologia","DEC","2005","146","2",NA,"","","","227","233","","10.1007/s00442-005-0192-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-005-0192-3","","","7","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","992HV","16028093","",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000233875900007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We anal zed stereographic aerial photographs of a 42,020-ha area taken in 1971, 1984, and 1999 will; GRASS, a geographic information system. What in 1971 was a nearly, continuous high-quality forest is now fragmented and severely, degraded. Between 1971 and 1999, 44% of conserved forest (forest with >80% cover) was degraded, and the largest patch of high-quality, forest was reduced from 27,115 ha to 5827 ha. The annual rate of degradation from 1971 to 1984 was 1.70%, and this increased to 2.41% during the next 15 years, At the latter rate, <10,000 ha of high-quality forest will remain in 20 years and <4,500 ha in,50,years. A subset of the analysis quantified changes in a 6596ha area on the Sierra Chincua, Sierra Campanario, and Cerro Chivati Huacal massifis that were declared protected by presidential decree in 1986 Corresponding rates of degradation of these reserves more than tripled from approximately, 1.0% between 1971 and 1984 to more than 3% between 1984 and 1999. Passage of the 1986 decree failed to protect the forest. Our data provide irrefutable evidence that successful implementation of a more inclusive presidential decree issued in November 2000 will require (1) effective enforcement against logging within the oyamel-pine forest ecosystem and (2) restoration of areas that have been degraded. All indications are that the rate of logging is increasing throughout the area.

Three of these peptides designated as G75:AES1/2 (128-135), G60: AES1/2 (127-137) and G61: AES1/2 (125-133) correspond to the wildtype AES sequence, while the fourth G76:GPLTPLPV AES1/2 (128-135) corresponds to a variant sequence of the peptide G75 with the N-terminal Leu substituted to glycine. These sequences were chosen for study because mass-spectrometric analysis (MS) of a CTL active HPLC peptide fraction eluted from immunoaffinity precipitated HLA-A2 molecule, revealed: (a) the presence of an ion with a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) Of 793 which was more abundant than other ions of similar masses; (b) the tentatively reconstituted sequence of the ion 793 matched the sequence of peptide G76. We found that AES peptides G75 (128-135) and G76 (128-135) (L128G) reconstituted CTL recognition at concentrations ranging between 200-500 nM. These concentrations are lower than concentrations reported to activate effector function of CTL recognizing other epithelial tumor Ag. Furthermore, analysis with cloned CD8(+) T cells indicated that G75 and G76 were not cross-reactive specificities, suggesting a key role for the N-terminal residues of the variant peptide in dictating specificities. Since the AES proteins are part of a set of transcriptional repressors encoded by the Enhancer of split [E(spl)] genes, and since these repressors are activated to suppress cell differentiation in response to Notch receptors signalling, the AES peptides may represent a novel class of self-antigens that deserve further consideration as tumor Ag in epithelial cancers.

On the other side, the presence of compounds like agnuside (6), adoxosidic acid (11), monotropein (12), 6,7-dihydromonotropein (13), methyl oleoside (14) and methyl glucooleoside (15) is of high interest because, first of all, they have never been reported before in Lamiales. In second instance, the majority of the last compounds are formally derived from a different biogenetic pathway which involves deoxyloganic acid/loganin and led to the formation of decarboxylated iridoid showing the 8-configuration. Furthermore, a second abnormality was found during our study and this regards compounds 14 and 15 which are seco-iriodids and thus not typical for this family. The presence of these unusual compounds, biogenetically not related to species belonging to Lamiales, is a clear evidence of the metabolites transfer from the hosts. In fact, the collection area is also populated by species belonging to Oleaceae and Ericaceae which could be the possible hosts since the biosynthesis of seco-iridoids and or iridoids related to deoxyloganic acid/loganin pathway, with the 8-configuration, is well documented in these species.","[Venditti, Alessandro; Bianco, Armandodoriano] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Chem, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Venditti, Alessandro; Frezza, Claudio; Foddai, Sebastiano; Serafini, Mauro; Nicoletti, Marcello] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Environm Biol, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Sapienza University Rome; Sapienza University Rome","Venditti, A (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Chem, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.;Venditti, A (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Environm Biol, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.","alessandro.venditti@uniroma1.it","Frezza, Claudio/AAJ-8661-2021; Venditti, Alessandro/I-2432-2019","Venditti, Alessandro/0000-0003-1492-6739; frezza, claudio/0000-0002-2968-5264","","","",NA,"45","10","10","0","7","WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH","WEINHEIM","POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","1612-1872","1612-1880","","CHEM BIODIVERS","Chem.

This introduced pathogen has been characterized as having low genetic diversity in North America, yet it has demonstrated a capacity to invade diverse environments. The recent discovery of this rust fungus on the telial host Pedicularis racemosa Dougl. ex Benth., raises questions of whether this host association represents a recent acquisition by C. ribicola or a long-standing host association that was overlooked. Here we explore two questions: (i) is host specialization detectable at a local scale and (ii) is the capacity to infect Pedicularis racemosa local or widespread? Genetic analysis of C. ribicola isolates from different aecial and telial hosts provided no evidence for genetic differentiation and showed similar levels of expected heterozygosity within a geographic population. An inoculation test showed that diverse C. ribicola sources from across North America had the capacity to infect Pedicularis racemosa. These results support a hypothesis that ability to infect Pedicularis racemosa is common in C. ribicola from North America. Utilization of Pedicularis racemosa by C. ribicola may be dependent on the co-occurrence of this host, inoculum, and favorable environments.","US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; Washington State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Washington State University","Richardson, BA (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, 1221 S Main St, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.","brichardson02@fs.fed.us","","","","","",NA,"49","11","13","0","15","NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA-N R C RESEARCH PRESS","OTTAWA","BUILDING M 55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA","0008-4026","","","CAN J BOT","Can.

Parasitism can be debilitating to the host plant, and some of the world's most pernicious agricultural pests are parasitic weeds. We demonstrate here that interfering hairpin constructs transformed into host plants can silence expression of the targeted genes in the parasite. Transgenic roots of the hemi-parasitic plant Triphysaria versicolor expressing the GUS reporter gene were allowed to parasitize transgenic lettuce roots expressing a hairpin RNA containing a fragment of the GUS gene (hpGUS). When stained for GUS activity, Triphysaria roots attached to non-transgenic lettuce showed full GUS activity, but those parasitizing transgenic hpGUS lettuce lacked activity in root tissues distal to the haustorium. Transcript quantification indicated a reduction in the steady-state level of GUS mRNA in Triphysaria when they were attached to hpGUS lettuce. These results demonstrate that the GUS silencing signal generated by the host roots was translocated across the haustorium interface and was functional in the parasite. Movement across the haustorium was bi-directional, as demonstrated in double-junction experiments in which non-transgenic Triphysaria concomitantly parasitized two hosts, one transgenic for hpGUS and the other transgenic for a functional GUS gene. Observation of GUS silencing in the second host demonstrated that the silencing trigger could be moved from one host to another using the parasite as a physiological bridge. Silencing of parasite genes by generating siRNAs in the host provides a novel strategy for controlling parasitic weeds.","[Tomilov, Alexey A.; Tomilova, Natalia B.; Yoder, John I.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wroblewski, Tadeusz; Michelmore, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Genome Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA","University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis","Yoder, JI (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","jiyoder@ucdavis.edu","","","National Science Foundation [0236545]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems [0236545] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS))","The authors thank Tatiana Filippova, Pradeepa Gunathilake and John Bowman (Monash University) for helpful discussions on this paper.

Here we tested whether iridoid glycosides might deter or inhibit various soil and litter-dwelling potential enemies and pathogens. In choice experiments presenting L. melanocephalus pupae together with Tribolium castaneum pupae, the predator Lithobius forficatus was deterred by the iridoid glycoside Containing pupae. While Forficula auricularia as well as the nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora were not deterred. L. forficatus also avoided artificial baits doted with 2% iridoid glycosides while F auricularia showed no aversion to iridoid glycosides at these concentrations and H. bacteriophora did not suffer any toxic effect. Of the pathogens tested, the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae were not in their growth by glycosides ranging up to 2% However, an inhibitory effect Could be observed against the entomopathogenic bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, even at the relatively small concentrations that are common in L. melanocephalus.

In cases where the respective authors had not indicated the opposite, all compounds detected in Orobanche taxa were regarded as genuine Orobanche natural products. From the about 200 species of Orobanche s.l.

For two species of Orobanche and one of Phelipanche dedicated studies have been performed to analyze the phenomenon of natural product sequestration by parasitic plants from their host plants. In total, 70 presumably genuine natural products and 19 sequestered natural products have been described from Orobanche s.l.; these form the basis of 140 chemosystematic records (natural product reports per taxon). Bioactivities described for Orobanche s.l. extracts and natural products isolated from Orobanche species include in addition to antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, e.g., analgesic, antifungal and antibacterial activities, inhibition of amyloid aggregation, memory enhancing effects as well as anti-hypertensive effects, inhibition of blood platelet aggregation, and diuretic effects.

Removal was implemented and coordinated by the regional environmental Council, National security forces and public companies. Immediately after its detection, the distribution and abundance of water hyacinth, and the possible origin of introduction were assessed as the basis for selecting a feasible removal method. Plants were scattered across 110 ha and a perimeter of 8.4 km. A total biomass of 1,931 kg (fresh weight) was removed between May and December 2021 by combining manual removal from water using inflatable boats, floating booms, wetsuits and fishing waders, as well as removal from the shore. In total, the action cost ca. (sic)22,500. Most biomass (83%) was removed during the initial control phase (one month). However, most of the efforts and costs (83%) were made in the following seven months, especially for monitoring and follow-up treatments. Rapid response avoided the growth, blooming and spread that could be expected in summer, coinciding with the optimal growing conditions. Moreover, rapid response reduced ca. 50 times the biomass and control costs with respect to a delayed action (i.e., after summer). Despite the fact that monitoring required a higher effort and cost than the initial control phase, it altogether represented a great cost saving as the invasion was kept at bay. The coordination between the regional Council, National security forces and public companies has taken advantage of the specific strengths of each one of them, achieving the shortest possible response time.","[Garcia-de-Lomas, Juan; Dana, Elias D.; Borrero, Jose; Maria Martinez, Jose] Agencia Medio & Ambiente Agua Andalucia, Consejeria Agr Ganaderia Pesca & Desarrollo Soste, Seville, Spain; [Garcia-de-Lomas, Juan] Res Grp Struct & Dynam Aquat Ecosyst, Cadiz, Spain; [Yuste, Javier; Corpas, Antonio] Grp Tragsa SEPI, Seville, Spain; [Boniquito, Jose M.; Castilleja, Francisco J.] PACPRONA, Seville, Spain; [Boniquito, Jose M.; Castilleja, Francisco J.] GEAS, Guardia Civil, Seville, Spain; [Rodriguez, Carmen] Consejeria Agr Ganaderia Pesca & Desarrollo Soste, DG Gest Medio Nat Espacios Protegidos & Biodivers, Seville, Spain; [Verloove, Filip] Meise Bot Garden, Nieuwelaan 38, B-1860 Meise, Belgium","","Verloove, F (corresponding author), Meise Bot Garden, Nieuwelaan 38, B-1860 Meise, Belgium.","filip.verloove@botanicgardenmeise.be","García-de-Lomas, Juan/P-8217-2015","García-de-Lomas, Juan/0000-0002-1818-1941","[2017/M/00068]","","This work was funded through the project Field management actions on invasive alien species in Andalusia, co-financed at 75% with EAFRD European funds (2017/M/00068).",NA,"44","3","3","2","2","REGIONAL EURO-ASIAN BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS CENTRE-REABIC","HELSINKI","PO BOX 3, HELSINKI, 00981, FINLAND","1989-8649","","","MANAG BIOL INVASION","Manag.

Aim of the study: We investigated the protective effect of the methanol stem bark extract of P. tomentosa using an animal model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Materials and methods: The UPLC Q-TOF-MS profiles for the methanol extract of P. tomentosa stem bark showed that verbascoside and isoverbascoside were the predominant compounds. Raw 264.7 cells were used for inhibitory effects of cytokine production in vitro. C57BL/6 N mice were administered intranasally with LPS (10 mu g/per mouse) to induce ALI. H & E staining was used to evaluate histological changes in the lung. Results: Treatment with P. tomentosa stem bark extract (PTBE) suppressed the production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, and the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages in the BALF of mice with LPS-induced ALI. PTBE also decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro inflammatory cytokines in the BALF. PTBE reduced the levels of nitric oxide (NO) in the serum and of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the lung of ALI mice. PTBE also attenuated the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the lung. In addition, PTBE suppressed the activation of NF-kappa B and the reduced expression of superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) in the lung. Conclusion: The results suggest that PTBE has a protective effect on LPS-induced ALI.","[Lee, Jae-Won; Seo, Kyeong-Hwa; Ryu, Hyung Won; Yuk, Heung Joo; Park, Hyun Ah; Lim, YouRim; Ahn, Kyung-Seop; Oh, Sei-Ryang] Korea Res Inst Biosci & Biotechnol, Nat Med Res Ctr, 30 Yeongudanji Ro, Chungbuk 363883, South Korea","Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB)","Oh, SR (corresponding author), Korea Res Inst Biosci & Biotechnol, Nat Med Res Ctr, 30 Yeongudanji Ro, Chungbuk 363883, South Korea.","suc369@kribb.re.kr; kyeonghwseo@korea.kr; cupid6@kribb.re.kr; ryuhw@kribb.re.kr; hyunah00@kribb.re.kr; youlim@kribb.re.kr; ksahn@kribb.re.kr; seiryang@kribb.re.kr","Yuk, Heung Joo/T-5882-2019","Yuk, Heung Joo/0000-0002-4705-4538; Lee, Jae-Won/0000-0003-0438-6732; OH, SEI-RYANG/0000-0002-9769-4779","Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology Research Initiative Program [KGM 1221713]; Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Republic of Korea [HI14C1277]","Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology Research Initiative Program; Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Health & Welfare (MOHW), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by grants from Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology Research Initiative Program (KGM 1221713) and the Ministry of Health and Welfare (HI14C1277) of the Republic of Korea.",NA,"46","39","39","2","54","ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD","CLARE","ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND","0378-8741","","","J ETHNOPHARMACOL","J.

This dual action suggests particular sensitivity of the parasite to climate change and any associated impacts on hosts and other members of the community. While little research has addressed the responses of parasitic plants to climate change in natural environments, impacts are predicted from controlled environment studies together with a knowledge of the key ecophysiological traits of hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae, in particular of Striga species, which are important weeds in semi-arid tropical agro-ecosystems, and Rhinanthus species, which can be important components of (principally) grassland communities in the northern temperate zone. The main mode of action of both elevated CO2 and warming will be through changes in photosynthesis and stomatal functioning. Enhanced photosynthesis of the hemiparasite and host will increase parasite carbon gains but may also increase the demand for host mineral nutrients. Mineral nutrition may, therefore, mediate the impacts of climate change on host-parasite associations. The relative insensitivity of hemiparasite stomata to elevated CO2 suggests that high stomatal conductances may be maintained and thus solute uptake may become limited by soil drying driven by higher rates of evapotranspiration and reduced precipitation. Climate change impacts on host-parasite interactions at the individual level will ultimately affect hemiparasite impacts at the community level. Community impacts will be greatest where climate change considerably favours hemiparasite populations or, conversely, causes them to disappear from communities where they were formerly abundant. Impacts will further be mediated by climate impacts on hosts, and the natural enemies of hosts and parasites alike. Further, the wide host range of many root hemiparasitic plants may facilitate migration of their populations through new communities under a changing climate.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","University of Sheffield","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.","m.c.press@sheffield.ac.uk","Press, Malcolm Colin/ABB-3995-2021","Phoenix, Gareth/0000-0002-0911-8107","","","",NA,"60","26","30","1","64","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1211-9520","1874-9348","","FOLIA GEOBOT","Folia Geobot.","","2005","40","2-3",NA,"","","","205","216","","10.1007/BF02803235","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02803235","","","12","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Plant Sciences","945YZ",NA,"",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000230540200008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The aerial adventitious roots of T. sutchuenensis grow down the host trunk, producing haustoria that invade the host bark. Using brightfield and epifluorescence microscopy, we identified anatomical and histochemical features that allow this species to parasitize its host. The aerial adventitious roots are polyarch, with prominent metaxylem, initial secondary xylem in the stele, and an exodermis with Casparian bands and suberin lamellae; the roots do not have an evident endodermis. The cortex releases protein-rich secretions by decomposing the exodermis and the cork, and the phellogen produces cork to enclose these ruptures. The haustoria have tracheids and vessel elements that penetrate the host bark in all directions, forming xylematic concentric rings at maturity. The shoots have thick cuticles, and the leaf blade mesophyll is not differentiated in spongy and palisadic parenchyma. The root protein secretions may soften and dissolve host bark, facilitating its penetration by the haustoria. Apoplastic barriers consisting of the exodermis, cork, and thick cuticle, protect T. sutchuenensis while it parasitizes its host. Thus, several structures of T. sutchuenensis are consistent with a parasitic lifestyle: the proteins secreted by the aerial adventitious roots, the concentric rings in the haustorium, and the apoplastic barriers.","[Zhou, Cunyu; Zhang, Xia; Li, Teng; Zhang, Mengdi; Cai, Xiaodong; Yang, Chaodong] Yangtze Univ, Engn Res Ctr Ecol & Agr Use Wetland, Minist Educ, Jingzhou 434025, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Cunyu; Zhang, Xia; Li, Teng; Zhang, Mengdi; Cai, Xiaodong; Yang, Chaodong] Yangtze Univ, Hubei Key Lab Waterlogging Disaster & Agr Use Wet, Jingzhou 434025, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yingchun; Zhou, Chunhui; Long, Shuizhi; Mei, Yujiao] Ningxia Control & Quarantine Stn Forest Dis & Pes, Yinchuan 750001, Ningxia, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yingchun; Zhou, Chunhui; Long, Shuizhi; Mei, Yujiao] Shennongjia Natl Pk Adm, Hubei Prov Key Lab Conservat Biol Shennongjia Gol, Shennongjia Forestry 442400, Hubei, Peoples R China","Yangtze University; Yangtze University","Yang, CD (corresponding author), Yangtze Univ, Engn Res Ctr Ecol & Agr Use Wetland, Minist Educ, Jingzhou 434025, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Yang, CD (corresponding author), Yangtze Univ, Hubei Key Lab Waterlogging Disaster & Agr Use Wet, Jingzhou 434025, Hubei, Peoples R China.","619513671@qq.com; 157479669@qq.com; 925067575@qq.com; 3271676954@qq.com; 524854847@qq.com; 1584385415@qq.com; 724747348@qq.com; 2980496653@qq.com; 521194563@qq.com; 546728708@qq.com","wang, yan/JBJ-7462-2023; wang, ying/GQY-5077-2022; wang, yingying/GRS-3058-2022; wang, yan/GSE-6489-2022; Wang, Ying/HJI-2509-2023; wang, yingying/JCE-4984-2023; Wang, Yiping/IZQ-2052-2023","","Engineering Research Center of Ecology and Agriculture Use of Wetland, Ministry of Education opening fund, Yangtze University [KFT202004]; Major Program on Technology Innovation of Hubei Province [2019ACA162]; Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Conservation Biology for Shennongjia Golden Monkey Opening Fund [SNJGKL202002]","Engineering Research Center of Ecology and Agriculture Use of Wetland, Ministry of Education opening fund, Yangtze University; Major Program on Technology Innovation of Hubei Province; Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Conservation Biology for Shennongjia Golden Monkey Opening Fund","This work was supported by the Engineering Research Center of Ecology and Agriculture Use of Wetland, Ministry of Education opening fund, Yangtze University (KFT202004), Major Program on Technology Innovation of Hubei Province (2019ACA162), and Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Conservation Biology for Shennongjia Golden Monkey Opening Fund (SNJGKL202002).",NA,"67","0","0","3","25","ELSEVIER GMBH","MUNICH","HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY","0367-2530","1618-0585","","FLORA","Flora","NOV","2021","284","",NA,"","","","","","151936","10.1016/j.flora.2021.151936","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2021.151936","","SEP 2021","8","Plant Sciences; Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","WE8VR",NA,"",NA,NA,"2024-07-01","WOS:000705897600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Both stem-breaking and bedding occur throughout the range of moose and these behaviors together create disturbed patches, which increase habitat heterogeneity forest-wide. Here, we explore this phenomenon in two ways: a case study in which we quantify the size of moose beds and evaluate the physical and taxonomic extent of stem breaking for more than 300 broken trees at seven sites in western Massachusetts and Connecticut, and a literature review on stem-breaking. In our case study, moose broke the stems of 17 deciduous woody species and were twice as likely to snap main stems rather than lateral stems. After breaking a stem, moose browsed shoot tips 96% of the time. Moose snapped primarily shade-intolerant or intermediately tolerant species (92%); the frequency of broken shade-intolerant trees was 2-4 times greater than the frequency of their occurrence in the stand, and the only shade-tolerant species moose broke were shrubs or understory tree species. We measured the 10 moose beds that we encountered; they ranged in size from 1.5-3.4 m(2) (mean = 2.5 m(2)). We performed a systematic review of stem breaking by moose throughout their range and found 14 publications that characterized stem-breaking by moose in Europe and North America. These studies typically focused on a few tree species of economic importance, on how stem-breaking increased forage access to the tips of broken trees, or how moose damage in general redirected or delayed succession. The one report of stem-breaking across all species found 1% of all trees were broken, while as many as 60% of individuals of preferred species were broken at sites in both North America and Europe. Stem-breaking contributes to keeping some forest stands in an earlier stage of succession, and bedding may create small patches of crushed vegetation that may enhance local plant diversity at small spatial scales. Thus, our findings and review support previous research that characterize moose as ecosystem engineers, keystone species, or both.","[Olmsted, Castilleja F.; Betras, Tiffany; Pasquini, Sarah C.; Carson, Walter P.] Univ Pittsburgh, Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [DeStefano, Stephen] Univ Massachusetts, Massachusetts Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Faison, Edward] Highstead Fdn, Redding, CT 06875 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst","Carson, WP (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.","walt@pitt.edu","Pasquini, Sarah C/A-9731-2011; Olmsted, Castilleja/AAK-3697-2021; Carson, Walter P/A-2569-2013","Olmsted, Castilleja/0000-0001-9554-4024;","Harvard Forest; Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation","Harvard Forest; Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation","We would like to thank Harvard Forest and the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation for funding and permitting the research, and Michelle Spicer, Lauren Schricker, Sara Kuebbing, Corlett Wood, Martin Turcotte, Emile Gluck-Thaler, and Samantha Catella for helpful comments.

The use of expert knowledge in conservation planning is difficult, however, because it is subjective, biased, and value-laden. Decision theory provides a systematic and comprehensive means for addressing experts' subjective-and sometimes contradictory-judgments in the design of nature reserves. Thus, the experts can separate the objective criteria from the subjective components of decision making that place value on those criteria. When linked to a geographic information system (GIS), these techniques foster consensus among experts by allowing the exploration of alternative designs in an iterative way. We used such a decision-analysis approach to redesign the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (MBBR) in central Mexico. We examined three reserve scenarios to identify the optimal overwintering habitats considering (1) an area equivalent to the previously defined boundaries of the core zone of the MBBR (4500 ha); (2) an area equivalent to the previously defined boundaries of the whole MBBR (16,000 ha); and (3) the maximum possible extent for a new core zone. This last scenario produced an area of 21,727 ha. These results were transferred to the GIS to create the respective nominal maps that were presented to the environmental authorities, who selected the third scenario for the core zone of the new MBBR. Our results allowed us to locate the prime overwintering habitats precisely and to delimit a core area for the reserve that would minimize the inclusion of forest stands valuable to local loggers.","Univ Arizona, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Sweet Briar Coll, Dept Biol, Sweet Briar, VA 24595 USA; World Wildlife Fund, Mexico City 06100, DF, Mexico; Inst Politecn Nacl, Escuela Nacl Ciencias Biol, Dept Bot, Mexico City 11340, DF, Mexico; Texas Monarch Watch, Austin, TX 78704 USA; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","University of Arizona; Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","","l_boj@yahoo.com","","Bojorquez-Tapia, Luis A/0000-0001-6764-8803","","","",NA,"32","40","50","0","38","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0888-8892","1523-1739","","CONSERV BIOL","Conserv.

These traits have important impacts on host plants and non-host plants, and influence interactions with other trophic levels. Ultimately, they can affect community structure and functioning. Here, we review these physiological traits and discuss their ecological consequences. 2 The root hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae form a convenient subset of the parasitic angiosperms for study because: they are the most numerous and most widely distributed group of parasitic angiosperms; their physiological characteristics have been well studied; they are important in both agricultural and (semi)natural communities; and they are tractable as experimental organisms. 3 Key traits include: high transpiration rates; competition with the host for nutrients and haustorial metabolism of host-derived solutes; uptake of host-derived secondary metabolites; dual autotrophic and heterotrophic carbon nutrition; distinct carbohydrate biochemistry; high nutrient concentrations in green leaf tissue and leaf litter; and small (often hairless and non-mycorrhizal) roots. 4 Impacts on the host are detrimental, which can alter competitive balances between hosts and non-hosts and thus result in community change. Further impacts may result from effects on the abiotic environment, including soil water status, nutrient cycling and leaf/canopy temperatures. 5 However, for non-host species and for organisms that interact with these (e.g. herbivores and pollinators) or for those that benefit from changes in the abiotic environment, the parasites may have an overall positive effect, suggesting that at the community level, hemiparasites may also be considered as mutualists. 6 It is clear that through their distinctive suite of physiological traits hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae, have considerable impacts on community structure and function, can have both competitive and positive interactions with other plants, and can impact on other trophic levels. Many community level effects of parasitic plants can be considered analogous to those of other parasites, predators or herbivores.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","University of Sheffield","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.","m.c.press@sheffield.ac.uk","Press, Malcolm Colin/ABB-3995-2021","Phoenix, Gareth/0000-0002-0911-8107","","","",NA,"102","71","85","0","72","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0022-0477","1365-2745","","J ECOL","J.

For example, specific predictions about how differential pathogen load is hypothesised to drive host competitive outcomes are rarely tested. Additionally, although infection is known to affect mutualists, we rarely measure the magnitude of pathogen effects on mutualist abundance across host competitive contexts. We tested for both mechanisms in a plant-rhizobia-nematode system. We paired the legume Medicago lupulina with intraspecific and interspecific plant competitors, with and without a generalist nematode parasite Meloidogyne sp. Relative change in plant biomass was used to determine how nematode inoculation affected plant competitive outcomes. We counted nematode galls to test for direct effects of parasitism on plant competition and rhizobia nodules to test for indirect effects of nematode presence on rhizobium abundance. Parasites were destabilising despite similar nematode load across competition treatments. During interspecific compared with intraspecific competition, nematode inoculation decreased nodulation on M. lupulina, increased nodulation on Trifolium repens and had no effect on nodulation on Chamaecrista fasciculata. We found no support for hypothesised direct effects of nematode load on competitive outcomes and strong but idiosyncratic indirect effects of nematode inoculation on rhizobium abundance.","[Catella, Samantha A.; Olmsted, Castilleja Fallon; Markalanda, Shaniya H.; McFadden, Connor J.; Kuebbing, Sara E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, 4249 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Wood, Corlett W.] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, 433 South Univ Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of Pennsylvania","Catella, SA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, 4249 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.","samanthacatella@ucla.edu","Olmsted, Castilleja/AAK-3697-2021","Olmsted, Castilleja/0000-0001-9554-4024; Kuebbing, Sara/0000-0002-0834-8189; Catella, Samantha/0000-0002-8041-9009; Markalanda, Shaniya/0000-0001-5135-419X; Wood, Corlett/0000-0002-5089-5362","Pittsburgh Ecology and Evolution Postdoctoral Fellowship; University of Pittsburgh's Arts & Sciences Graduate Fellowship","Pittsburgh Ecology and Evolution Postdoctoral Fellowship; University of Pittsburgh's Arts & Sciences Graduate Fellowship","We thank the following researchers for their assistance: Jessica Poteet, Steve Cassidy, Kamron Woods, Audrey Burr, Pooja Jacobs, and Kristi Rozum and Laurie Follweiler for running the glasshouse facilities.

Grass-specific herbicides, graminicides, are a sought-after tool to reduce invasive grasses, augment forbs and enhance butterfly populations. However, possible non-target effects raise concern. We investigated non-target effects of graminicides on three species of caterpillars in the genus Euphydryas (Nymphalidae), a taxon with numerous species in decline worldwide. In one experiment, we compared the effects of three graminicides (clethodim, sethoxydim and fluazifop-p-butyl) on E. colon. In a second experiment, we assessed the effects of fluazifop-p-butyl, the most commonly used graminicide in prairies in the Northwest USA, on three Euphydryas species (E. colon, E. editha and E. phaeton), each raised on two different hostplants. In the first experiment, fluazifop-p-butyl did not affect survivorship of pre-diapause larvae, sethoxydim reduced survivorship by 20 % relative to controls, and effects of clethodim were inconclusive. Graminicides did not change the total concentration of iridoid glycosides in the caterpillars, but all three graminicides increased the concentration of aucubin to almost double the level in control treatments. In the second experiment, the effects of fluazifop-b-butyl were not consistent across butterfly and host plant species. However, fluazifop-b-butyl reduced group size of gregarious pre-diapause larvae under all conditions. Our results suggest that if managers use graminicides over the short-term to control invasive grasses, fluazifop-p-butyl has the most promise for minimal effects. However, efforts should be paired with demographic and behavioral monitoring to quantify context-dependent impacts.","[Schultz, Cheryl B.; Zemaitis, Jessica L.; Thomas, Cameron C.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 14204 NE Salmon Creek Ave, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA; [Bowers, M.

We measured responses of exotic and native species cover, species diversity, and occurrence frequency of shrubs and forbs seeded before (1 to 2 or 9 to 10 mo) herbicide application. Additionally, we asked whether landscape factors, including topography, species richness, and/or soil characteristics, influenced the effectiveness of imazapic. Cover of exotic annual grass cover, but not of deep-rooted perennial bunchgrass, was less where imazapic had been applied, whereas more variability was evident in the response of Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl) and seeded shrubs and forbs. Regression-tree analysis of the subset of plots measured both before and after the second fall application revealed greater reductions of exotic annual grass cover in places where their cover was <42% before spraying.

These 12 species appear to be absent from the extensive areas of suitable habitat that occur in the intervening areas.

A comparatively small, Western population migrates from states west of the Rocky Mountains to California, and a large Eastern population migrates from southern Canada and the United States to central Mexico. We monitored the dynamics and trends of monarch overwintering colonies in Mexico from the 2004-2005 to the 2013-2014 seasons. Of 19 colonies, 14 were inside the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve and five were outside the reserve. The number of colonies with butterflies varied among years, and in only three colonies were butterflies consistently present in all seasons. The total cumulative area of forest used by all monarch colonies in all seasons was 106.53 ha: 83.68% inside the reserve and 16.32% outside the reserve. By the 2013-2014 season, however, the surface occupied by monarchs (0.67 ha) had decreased 44% from the previous season, and is the smallest in two decades, far from the highest record of 18.19 ha in the 1996-1997 season. Extensive loss of breeding habitat by eradication of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca, the primary food source for monarchs) from herbicide use and land-use changes in the United States, extreme climate conditions in Canada, the United States and Mexico, and deforestation and forest degradation in overwintering sites in Mexico all contributed to the steady decline in the abundance of monarch butterflies. Unregulated tourism also has become a threat to the dwindling colonies in Mexico. Protection of overwintering sites in Mexico is crucial to conserve this butterfly in North America. Given the rapid decline of monarch overwintering sites documented here, it is critical to initiate an immediate and concerted effort to protect and restore habitat along the migratory routes in the three countries.
