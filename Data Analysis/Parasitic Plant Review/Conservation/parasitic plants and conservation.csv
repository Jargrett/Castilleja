In contrast, rare parasitic plants represent an uncommon challenge for conservation biologists and managers who often wish to bolster populations of these parasites. Although parasitic plants may suffer any of the maladies known to affect small populations of plants, parasitic plants may also be limited by the additional suite of factors of host availability, host quality, host resistance to parasitism, and parasite preference. We describe studies that have examined parasite growth and reproductive performance with a variety of host species to argue that consideration of the host needs of parasitic plants is necessary for successful conservation of rare species using this mode of resource acquisition. Although it is clear that parasite performance varies greatly with the availability of different host species, little is known about the host requirements of most parasitic plants, and the relative importance of particular host species may not immediately be obvious. Further, because published host lists generally do not distinguish minor hosts from those that sustain parasite populations, such lists may be misleading for conservation efforts. We argue that successful conservation and restoration of parasitic plants may necessitate the management of thoughtfully selected host populations.","UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ,DEPT BIOL,SANTA CRUZ,CA 95064; PRINCETON UNIV,DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,PRINCETON,NJ 08544",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Princeton University,,,"Smith, David L/L-8850-2013; Smith, David J/C-1995-2013","Smith, David L/0000-0003-4367-3849; Smith, David J/0000-0002-8810-4386; Marvier, Michelle/0000-0001-8360-9265",,,,,81,47,54,3,29,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148",0888-8892,,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

A. Rau) R. Prasad & R.D. Dixit (Scrophulariaceae). The plant comprises tremendous medicinal properties to treat many diseases such as leprosy, leucoderma, tuberculosis and paralysis. The protocol has been developed using rhizome explant on the modified Murashige and Skoog medium containing various phytohormones to raise complete plantlets without any host interaction. 0.5 mg/l kinetin and 1.0 mg/l NAA was found to be the most excellent medium combination to obtain plantlets with an average shoot length of 11 +/- 1.04 cm; and 100% response for rooting. The same medium combination also supported flowering in vitro. Further, comparative molecular and chemical characterization of in vitro and in vivo grown plants were carried out by performing RAPD and HPTLC analysis, respectively, to make sure the genetic as well as chemical stability among the plants. RAPD analysis with MAP (01-20) and OPJ primers (01-20) exhibited a monomorphic band pattern which revealed the genetic similarities among the tested plants. Similarly, presence of azafrin, the most important pharmaceutically active compound in in vitro generated plants indicates the efficacy of protocol to fulfill the objective of in vitro propagation of this critically endangered plant species. Moreover, the present study is the first report towards in vitro conservation of parasitic plant A. chitrakutensis without host from the rhizome explant.","[Sharma, Shital Kailsh; Patil, Anita] St Gadge Baba Amravati Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Plant Secondary Metabolite Lab, Lab 106, Amravati 444602, MS, India; [Agnihotri, Adarsh Kumar; Mehrotra, Shakti] Mahatma Gandhi Inst Rural Industrializat, Bioproc & Herbal Div, Wardha 442001, MS, India; [Mehrotra, Shakti] Cent Inst Med & Aromat Plants, Plant Biotechnol Div, PO CIMAP,Picn Spot Rd, Lucknow 226015, Uttar Pradesh, India",Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants (CIMAP),"Sharma, SK (corresponding author), St Gadge Baba Amravati Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Plant Secondary Metabolite Lab, Lab 106, Amravati 444602, MS, India.",shital_sharma24@yahoo.co.in,"University, Sant Gadge Baba Amravati/AAN-5820-2021","University, Sant Gadge Baba Amravati/0000-0002-3759-6755","Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise, Gov. of India, New Delhi, India [C-3]","Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise, Gov. of India, New Delhi, India","The authors are grateful to Prof. M.K.

The invasive species involved may be introduced, or native invaders, and controlling them is a major global challenge. Here, we highlight an emerging role for native parasitic plants in suppressing invasive species, thus aiding in restoration of affected habitats. Compelling empirical evidence is provided by three study systems located in Central Europe, southern Australia and eastern China. Further cases of parasitism of invasive plants have been recorded across five continents. We propose including the interactions between parasitic and invasive plants into the theoretical framework of the biotic resistance hypothesis concerning generalist interactions between invaders and native biota. Among parasitic plants, numerous root hemiparasites, mistletoes and parasitic vines show low host specificity and exert substantial negative effects on their hosts. These parasitic plants may interfere with key traits of invaders such as symbiotic nitrogen fixation or clonal propagation which provide them with competitive advantage over native species. We contend that some parasitic plants may present a cost-effective environmentally sustainable component of invasion management schemes. Therefore, we encourage exploration of this potential and the development of methods for practical applications in ecological restoration and nature conservation.","[Tesitel, Jakub] Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic; [Cirocco, Robert M.; Facelli, Jose M.; Watling, Jennifer R.] Univ Adelaide, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Watling, Jennifer R.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Ecol & Environm Res Ctr, Manchester, Lancs, England",Masaryk University Brno; University of Adelaide; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Tesitel, J (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic.",tesitel@sci.muni.cz,"Cirocco, Robert/AAV-6410-2021","Cirocco, Robert/0000-0002-1609-2531; Watling, Jennifer/0000-0001-6305-9905",Czech Science Foundation [19-28491X]; Australian Research Council Linkage Project [LP 0667863],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Australian Research Council Linkage Project(Australian Research Council),JT was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (project no. 19-28491X).

The 'extended specimen' concept advocates a more holistic approach in which a specimen is framed as a diverse stream of interconnected data. Herbarium specimens that by their very nature capture multispecies relationships, such as certain parasites, fungi and lichens, hold great potential to provide a broader and more integrative view of the ecology and evolution of symbiotic interactions. This particularly applies to parasite-host associations, which owing to their interconnectedness are especially vulnerable to global environmental change. Here, we present an overview of how parasitic flowering plants is represented in herbarium collections. We then discuss the variety of data that can be gathered from parasitic plant specimens, and how they can be used to understand global change impacts at multiple scales. Finally, we review best practices for sampling parasitic plants in the field, and subsequently preparing and digitizing these specimens. Plant parasitism has evolved 12 times within angiosperms, and similar to other plant taxa, herbarium collections represent the foundation for analysing key aspects of their ecology and evolution. Yet these collections hold far greater potential. Data and metadata obtained from parasitic plant specimens can inform analyses of co-distribution patterns, changes in eco-physiology and species plasticity spanning temporal and spatial scales, chemical ecology of tripartite interactions (e.g. host-parasite-herbivore), and molecular data critical for species conservation. Moreover, owing to the historic nature and sheer size of global herbarium collections, these data provide the spatiotemporal breadth essential for investigating organismal response to global change. Parasitic plant specimens are primed to serve as ideal examples of extended specimen concept and help motivate the next generation of creative and impactful collection-based science. Continued digitization efforts and improved curatorial practices will contribute to opening these specimens to a broader audience, allowing integrative research spanning multiple domains and offering novel opportunities for education.","[Teixeira-Costa, Luiza; Davis, Charles C.] Harvard Univ Herbaria, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Teixeira-Costa, Luiza] Hanse Wissenschaftskolleg Inst Adv Study, Delmenhorst, Germany; [Heberling, J.

Conservation tillage and subsidiary crops, applied as cover crops and living mulches, generally improve soil health by increasing soil organic matter content and stimulating soil microbial activity. However, more permanent crop and weed cover associated with subsidiary crops and noninversion tillage, respectively, may benefit plant-parasitic nematodes with broad host spectra such as Meloidogyne and Pratylenchus. These genera are major constraints to many field crops throughout Europe and there is a need to identify effective and reliable management options that can be applied to avoid excessive infestations. The dynamics of the indigenous fauna of plant-parasitic nematodes were studied in eight coordinated multi-environment field experiments (MEEs) under four agro-environmental conditions in Europe (Continental, Nemoral, Atlantic North and Mediterranean North). The MEEs consisted of a 2-year sequence of wheat combined with a living mulch or subsequent cover crops and second main crops maize, potatoes or tomatoes depending on site. Additionally, the effects of inversion tillage using the plough were compared with various forms of conservation tillage (no-tillage, shallow and deep noninversion tillage). Overall, Helicotylenchus, Paratylenchus, Pratylenchus and Tylenchorhynchus were the most frequent genera across sites while Meloidogyne occurred only in Germany at very low densities. During the wheat-maize sequences in Switzerland, the populations of Pratylenchus increased from 63 to 146 nematodes per 100mL soil and Helicotylenchus from 233 to 632 nematodes per 100 mL soil. The effects of tillage on plant-parasitic nematodes were generally minor, although no tillage in Italy supported higher densities of Pratylenchus (184 nematodes per 100 mL soil) than inversion tillage (59 nematodes per 100 mL soil). Furthermore, Pratylenchus densities were 160 nematodes per 100 mL soil when leguminous subsidiary crops were grown, 122 nematodes per 100 mL soil in the green fallow and 84 nematodes per 100 mL soil after growing black oat (Avena strigosa) or oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus). The differences were greatest in Italy, in a sandy soil with low organic matter. Application of compost or nitrogen fertiliser had no consistent effects on plant-parasitic nematodes. We conclude that crop rotations including specific subsidiary crops are prominent factors affecting the indigenous nematode community, while tillage and fertiliser are of lower importance.","[Schmidt, J.

Only one family, Orobanchaceae, comprises all major nutritional types of parasites: facultative, hemiparasitic (partially photosynthetic), and holoparasitic (nonphotosynthetic) [2]. Additionally, the family includes Lindenbergia, a nonparasitic genus sister to all parasitic Orobanchaceae [3-6]. Parasitic Orobanchaceae include species with severe economic impacts: Striga (witchweed), for example, affects over 50 million hectares of crops in sub-Saharan Africa, causing more than $3 billion in damage annually [7]. Although gene losses and increased substitution rates have been characterized for parasitic plant plastid genomes [5, 8-111, the nuclear genome and transcriptome remain largely unexplored. The Parasitic Plant Genome Project (PPGP; http://ppgp.huck.psu.edu/) [2] is leveraging the natural variation in Orobanchaceae to explore the evolution and genomic consequences of parasitism in plants through a massive transcriptome and gene discovery project involving Triphysaria versicolor (facultative hemiparasite), Striga hermonthica (obligate hemiparasite), and Phelipanche aegyptiaca (Orobanche [12]; holoparasite). Here we present the first set of large-scale genomic resources for parasitic plant comparative biology. Transcriptomes of above-ground tissues reveal that, in addition to the predictable loss of photosynthesis-related gene expression in P. aegyptiaca, the nonphotosynthetic parasite retains an intact, expressed, and selectively constrained chlorophyll synthesis pathway.","[Wickett, Norman J.; Honaas, Loren A.; Wafula, Eric K.; Landherr, Lena; dePamphilist, Claude W.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Inst Mol Evolutionary Genet, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Wickett, Norman J.; Honaas, Loren A.; Wafula, Eric K.; Landherr, Lena; dePamphilist, Claude W.] Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Das, Malay; Westwood, James H.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol Physiol & Weed Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Huang, Kan; Timko, Michael P.] Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Wu, Biao; Yoder, John] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Virginia; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Wickett, NJ (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Inst Mol Evolutionary Genet, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",nwickett@chicagobotanic.org; cwd3@psu.edu,"dePamphilis, Claude W/P-6652-2016; Das, Malay/I-2492-2019; Wickett, Norman/AAV-8136-2021; Honaas, Loren/GWC-8659-2022","Wickett, Norman/0000-0003-0944-1956; Westwood, James/0000-0001-5127-7294; Das, Malay/0000-0002-5331-8157; Honaas, Loren/0000-0001-9187-8254",National Science Foundation [0701748]; US Department of Agriculture [135657]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems [0701748] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"Support by the National Science Foundation Plant Genome Research Program (IOS #0701748 to J.H.W., C.W.d., M.P.T., and J.Y.) for our work on the Parasitic Plant Genome Project, with additional support from the US Department of Agriculture (Hatch project number 135657 to J.H.W.), is gratefully acknowledged.

However, the vast majority of parasitic arthropods pose no threat to human health and instead contribute to the overall stability of communities to which they belong. The loss of parasitic arthropod biodiversity likely has repercussions for host health, population density, and community structure. The need for parasitic arthropod conservation is urgent given they represent the majority of parasitic animal biodiversity and environmental change is expected to pose a significant threat to their survival. We urge that microbial associations of host-parasitic arthropod assemblages be considered in conservation efforts. Parasitic arthropods are dependent on their microbial associates for development, nutrient acquisition, immune function, and reproduction. The microbiome also mediates the interactions between a parasitic arthropod and a host, and the role of a parasitic arthropod in vectoring pathogens to its host. The microbiome may therefore represent a weak link that increases the susceptibility of parasitic arthropods to environmental change. Fundamental knowledge is missing, precluding assessment of this complex association between microbes and parasitic arthropods. We highlight broad areas of future research that focus on building primary knowledge, developing experimental protocols and novel statistics, and leveraging new techniques to increase the resolution at which we can examine microbial communities of parasites. Conservation of parasitic arthropods that accounts for microbiota will likely be more effective at maintaining parasite biodiversity and at controlling arthropod-vectored disease emergence.","[Speer, Kelly A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Richard Gilder Grad Sch, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Speer, Kelly A.] Smithsonian Natl Zool Pk & Conservat Biol Inst, Ctr Conservat Genom, Washington, DC 20008 USA; [Speer, Kelly A.] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Dheilly, Nolwenn M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Dheilly, Nolwenn M.] Agence Natl Securite Sanit Alimentat Environm & T, ANSES, Unite Genet Virale Biosecurite, Lab Ploufragan Plouzane, Ploufragan, France; [Perkins, Susan L.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Sackler Inst Comparat Genom, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Perkins, Susan L.] CUNY City Coll, Div Sci, New York, NY 10031 USA","American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Agence Nationale de Securite Sanitaire de l'Alimentation, de l'Environnement du Travail (ANSES); Ploufragan-Plouzane Niort Laboratory; American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY)","Speer, KA (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Richard Gilder Grad Sch, New York, NY 10024 USA.",speerkelly@gmail.com,,"Speer, Kelly A./0000-0002-8775-7254",,,,,126,4,4,1,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,1873-2917,,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

However, little is known about the effects of changes in parasitic plant distribution on community-level interactions. Parasitic flowering plants make a limited numerical contribution to biodiversity. Their lifestyle may exhibit a moderate to the high degree of host dependence. Because of this host dependence, parasites may be more affected by environmental changes, such as climate change, compared to autotrophic representatives. To our knowledge, the effects of different climate change scenarios and their environmental variables on parasitic plants and their hosts have not yet been studied. This study aimed to construct a model which shows the current and future potential effects of climate change on the distribution of the two holoparasitic plants Hydnora abyssinica A.Br., and H. africana Thunb. in comparison to their respective Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae hosts. We projected the future distribution of these species and their host plants using five models, nine bioclimatic, and five environmental variables. The global circulation model (CMIP5) for the years 2050 and 2070, applying two representative concentration pathways scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) projected a 41-64% contraction of suitable habitats for H. abyssinica. For H. africana, more stable conditions are estimated, with a 12-28% contraction in suitable habitats, making this species putatively less prone to climate change effects, although this species has a more restricted distribution compared to H. abyssinica. Because climate change could affect the host differently than the parasites, the impact on the parasite could potentially be exacerbated due to host plant dependence. The models predict that the host plant distribution will be less affected, except for Vachelia Karroo, Vachellia xanthophloea, and Euphorbia gregaria, which indicated high contraction (40-66%). The predicted host species distribution ranges will only partially overlap with the respective distribution of the parasite.","[Mkala, Elijah Mbandi; Mutinda, Elizabeth Syowai; Waswa, Emmanuel Nyongesa; Oulo, Milicent Akinyi; Wanga, Vincent Okelo; Hu, Guang-Wan; Wang, Qing-Feng] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Plant Germplasm Enhancement & Special, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Mkala, Elijah Mbandi; Ngarega, Boniface K.; Mutinda, Elizabeth Syowai; Waswa, Emmanuel Nyongesa; Mwanzia, Virginia Mutheu; Oulo, Milicent Akinyi; Wanga, Vincent Okelo; Hu, Guang-Wan; Wang, Qing-Feng] Chinese Acad Sci, Sino Africa Joint Res Ctr, CN-430074 Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Mkala, Elijah Mbandi; Ngarega, Boniface K.; Mutinda, Elizabeth Syowai; Waswa, Emmanuel Nyongesa; Mwanzia, Virginia Mutheu; Oulo, Milicent Akinyi; Wanga, Vincent Okelo; Hu, Guang-Wan; Wang, Qing-Feng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, CN-100049 Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jost, Matthias; Wanke, Stefan] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Bot, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Wanke, Stefan] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Dept Bot, Apartado Postal 70-367, Coyoacan 04510, DF, Mexico; [Ngarega, Boniface K.] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Menglun 666303, Peoples R China; [Hughes, Alice] Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Ecol Grp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ngumbau, Veronica Mutele; Mwachala, Geoffrey] Natl Museums Kenya, East African Herbarium, POB 451660-0100, Nairobi, Kenya","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan Botanical Garden, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Technische Universitat Dresden; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, CAS; University of Hong Kong","Hu, GW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Plant Germplasm Enhancement & Special, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",guangwanhu@wbgcas.cn,"hughes, Alice/HCH-3838-2022; Wanke, Stefan/G-5860-2011","hughes, Alice/0000-0002-4899-3158; Jost, Matthias/0000-0003-2339-3241; Ngarega, Boniface K./0000-0001-8272-1837; WANGA, VINCENT OKELO/0000-0002-3788-1636","Hubei Provincial Key Research and Development Program [2020BHB022]; International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [151853KYSB20190027]; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [31970211]; Sino-Africa Joint Research Center, CAS [SAJC202101]","Hubei Provincial Key Research and Development Program; International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sino-Africa Joint Research Center, CAS","This work was financially supported by the Hubei Provincial Key Research and Development Program (2020BHB022) , the International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (151853KYSB20190027) , the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (31970211) , and the Sino-Africa Joint Research Center, CAS, (SAJC202101) .",,123,2,2,6,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1574-9541,1878-0512,,ECOL INFORM,Ecol.

Cryptic species represent an important component of biodiversity, such speciation being common among plant-parasitic nematodes and occurring in diverse groups with different life history traits, including the spiral, virus vector, root-lesion and false root-knot nematodes. Cryptic species are important for a number of reasons, including food security, quarantine, non-chemical management technologies and species conservation, and should not be ignored. The magnitude of the phenomenon is largely unknown, but the available data on plant-parasitic nematodes demonstrate that reliance on morphology alone for species delimitation seriously underestimates the total number of taxa.

Also, there is mounting evidence that the in planta generation of nematode-specific double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) has real utility in the control of these pests. Although neuronally-expressed genes in Caenorhabditis elegans are commonly refractory to RNAi, we have discovered that neuronally-expressed genes in plant-parasitic nematodes are highly susceptible to RNAi and that silencing can be induced by simple soaking procedures without the need for pharyngeal stimulation. Since most front-line anthelmintics that are used for the control of nematode parasites of animals and humans act to disrupt neuromuscular coordination, we argue that intercellular signalling processes associated with neurons have much appeal as targets for transgenic plant-based control strategies for plant-parasitic nematodes. FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs) are a large family of neuropeptides which are intimately associated with neuromuscular regulation, and our studies on flp gene function in plant-parasitic nematodes have revealed that their expression is central to coordinated locomotory activities. We propose that the high level of conservation in nervous systems across nematodes coupled with the RNAi-susceptibility of neuronally-expressed genes in plant-parasitic nematodes provides a valuable research tool which could be used to interrogate neuronal signalling processes in nematodes.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; Agri Food & Biosci Inst, Belfast BT9 5PX, Antrim, North Ireland; Iowa State Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; Queens University Belfast; Agri-Food & Biosciences Institute; Iowa State University,"Maule, AG (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",a.maule@qub.ac.uk,,"Maule, Aaron/0000-0003-0862-2667",,,,,53,5,5,0,12,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1388-5545,,,NEMATOLOGY,Nematology,,2007,9,,3,,,,301,315,,10.1163/156854107781351981,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854107781351981,,,15,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,197FP,,,,,2023-05-15,WOS:000248540300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Various flowering native, introduced/established and cultivated potted plants were used to bait interception traps along the wooded margins of fields planted seasonally with either feed-corn or rye. Depending on circumstances, controls consisted of traps baited with the same species of plant without flowers, a pot/area without plants, or both. In most cases pots were rotated among trap-sites. Of the 19 plant species tested, 10 captured significantly more summed ichneumonoids and chalcidoids, seven more Braconidae, two more Ichneumonidae and six more Chalcidoidea than controls. Among Braconidae, traps baited with certain plants captured significantly more individuals of specific subfamilies. Attractive and unattractive plant species tended to cluster in a principal components vector space constructed from plant morphological characteristics ( flower width, flower depth, flower density and plant height). Flower width and plant floral-area (flower width(2) * flower density) were the variables that most often explained the variance in capture of the different parasitoid taxa.

Increasing concern over chemical nematicides has increased interest in safe alternative methods to minimize these losses. This review focuses on the use and potential of current methods such as biologicals, botanicals, non-host crops, and related rotations, as well as modern techniques against PPNs in sustainable agroecosystems. To evaluate their potential for control, this review offers overviews of their interactions with other biotic and abiotic factors from the standpoint of PPN management. The positive or negative roles of specific production practices are assessed in the context of integrated pest management. Examples are given to reinforce PPN control and increase crop yields via dual-purpose, sequential, and co-application of agricultural inputs. The involved PPN control mechanisms were reviewed with suggestions to optimize their gains. Using the biologicals would preferably be backed by agricultural conservation practices to face issues related to their reliability, inconsistency, and slow activity against PPNs. These practices may comprise offering supplementary resources, such as adequate organic matter, enhancing their habitat quality via specific soil amendments, and reducing or avoiding negative influences of pesticides. Soil microbiome and planted genotypes should be manipulated in specific nematode-suppressive soils to conserve native biologicals that serve to control PPNs. Culture-dependent techniques may be expanded to use promising microbial groups of the suppressive soils to recycle in their host populations. Other modern techniques for PPN control are discussed to maximize their efficient use.","[Abd-Elgawad, Mahfouz M.

Rafflesia arnoldii is one of Indonesian endemic plants that grows in Sumatra island. This island is also known to have eleven species of Tetrastigma. Three of them are known as host plants of R. arnoldii, namely Tetrastigma curtisii, T. pedunculare and T. leucostaphylum. Unfortunately, it is not possible to survey the entire native distribution range of R. arnoldii and its host plants due to practical constraints. Species Distribution Modeling using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) is considered to be an alternative way to understand the potential regions that are suitable for a species. Predicting habitat suitability of a parasitic plant through predicting its host plant distribution may be a useful approach. The model prediction from MaxEnt for all host species has an AUC value more than 0.70, indicating the model adequately classified the occurrence records of R. arnoldii and its host plants. Suitable habitats for R. arnoldii were predicted to occur along the Bukit Barisan Mountain range from Lampung to Aceh, mostly in Lampung, Bengkulu, West Sumatra and Aceh. However, the suitable habitats of R. arnoldii estimated from host plants were predicted to occur predominately in Lampung, Bengkulu, West Sumatra, North Sumatra and Aceh. The important environmental variables affecting the occurrence of R. arnoldii and its host plants are mean temperature, slope, elevation, soil organic carbon and soil type. Rafflesia species can be found in various soil types, but mostly in Humic Andosols, Humic Acrisols, Orthic Acrosols, Dystric Fluvisols, Dystric Cambisols and Eutric Fluvisols based on the actual data points and predicted habitats. The suitable habitats of R. arnoldii based on its host plants were predicted to be mostly outside conservation areas, but suitable habitats were predicted inside approximately 46 conservation areas. The findings of this study may be used by the Government of Republic Indonesia, c.q. Ministry of Environment and Foresty for establishing protected areas and conservation-based management improvement and could also help inform the R. arnoldii listing status in IUCN red list category in the future.","[Renjana, Elga; Astuti, Inggit Puji; Munawaroh, Esti; Mursidawati, Sofi; Witono, Joko Ridho; Yuzammi; Fijridiyanto, Izu Andry; Robiansyah, Iyan; Yudaputra, Angga] Natl Res & Innovat Agcy, Res Ctr Plant Conservat & Bot Gardens, Jalan Ir H Juanda 13, Bogor 16122, West Java, Indonesia; [Raharjo, Puguh Dwi] Natl Res & Innovat Agcy, Res Ctr Geotechnol, Jalan Sangkuriang, Bandung 40135, West Java, Indonesia; [Cropper, Wendell P., Jr.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Fisheries & Geomat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Solihah, Saniyatun Mar'atus] Bogor Bot Garden, Jalan Ir H Juanda 13, Bogor 16122, West Java, Indonesia",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; National Research & Innovation Agency of Indonesia (BRIN); Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI),"Renjana, E (corresponding author), Natl Res & Innovat Agcy, Res Ctr Plant Conservat & Bot Gardens, Jalan Ir H Juanda 13, Bogor 16122, West Java, Indonesia.",elga.renjana@brin.go.id; ingg001@brin.go.id; esti001@brin.go.id; sofi001@brin.go.id; joko017@brin.go.id; yuza001@brin.go.id; izua002@brin.go.id; pugu003@brin.go.id; sani_sms@rocketmail.com; iyan.robiansyah@brin.go.id; wcropper@ufl.edu; angg022@brin.go.id,"Cropper, Wendell P/E-5952-2010","Cropper, Wendell P/0000-0001-7851-7382; Yudaputra, Angga/0000-0002-5232-5662",,,,,66,1,1,5,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2351-9894,,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

The application of biological control has been inconsistent in suppressing nematode populations because the efficacy of antagonists is influenced by other soil organisms and the host-plant. Integration of biological control with nematicides, solarization, organic amendments, and crop rotation has also had varied success. Progress in biological control of nematodes has been hampered by the opaque nature of soil, the microscopic size of nematodes and their antagonists, and the complex interactions among soil organisms. Molecular biology offers new tools that will aid in determining which organisms are involved in naturally-suppressive soils, the fate of introduced antagonists, and how populations of indigenous and introduced antagonists change seasonally and with different crop production practices. Moreover, organisms have been engineered to over-express traits that enhance their activity against plant-parasitic nematodes.","ARS, Crop Protect & Management Res Unit, USDA, Tifton, GA 31793 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Timper, P (corresponding author), ARS, Crop Protect & Management Res Unit, USDA, POB 748, Tifton, GA 31793 USA.",Patricia.Timper@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,,171,32,34,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1573-5915,,978-1-4020-9647-1,PROG BIOL CONTROL,Prog.

But conservation of those iconic plants is important since they are key stone species to understand evolution and diversification in those ecosystems. We investigated the distribution, host plants and floral biology of a root holoparasite Langsdorffia hypogaea Mart. (Balanophoraceae) in the Brazilian Savanna of southern Brazil. Langsdorffia hypogaea showed an aggregated distribution in patches, and similar sex ratio and abundance between populations. The nectar was secreted by extra-floral structures at the basal bracts of females and among freshly open flowers on male inflorescences. Nectar was relatively dilute (11-18%), and concentration and volume did not differ between male and female flowers. We found five plant species of different families as hosts, confirming that L. hypogaea is a generalist and suggesting interactions with the local plant community based on abundance and/or host quality. Besides a non quantified number of insect species, we recorded for the first time a bird species visiting and possibly pollinating the inflorescences. Despite the limited observations, the information provided here opens interesting lines of investigation on the reproductive biology of this species. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

For this reason, non-inversion tillage systems including subsidiary crops have become popular over the last three decades in Europe. However, the adoption of new agricultural practices may change the diversity and abundance of certain pests and diseases. For example, plant-parasitic nematodes that are major threats towards cultivated plants may be promoted if good hosts, such as certain subsidiary crops and weeds, occur more frequently. The indigenous plant-parasitic nematode fauna under organic farming systems is already adapted to diverse crop rotations and usually dominated by nematodes with broad host ranges. These may be further enhanced in organic farming systems if non-inversion tillage is introduced, which generally increases the abundance and biomass of certain weeds. We evaluated the early effects of non-inversion tillage and subsidiary crops in an organic wheat-potato rotation on plant-parasitic nematodes in two field experiments in two successive years. The total densities of plant-parasitic nematodes increased from an initial 1260 nematodes (100 ml soil)(-1) at the start of the experiment to 1850 and 1700 nematodes (100 ml soil)(-1) after wheat under non-inversion and conventional tillage, respectively. Plant-parasitic nematode densities then decreased on average to 1100 and 560 nematodes (100 ml soil)(-1) after subsidiary crops and potatoes, respectively. Parasitic nematode densities tended to be higher under non-inversion than conventional tillage, except where oilseed radish and black oats had been used as cover crops. For the latter, no differences between tillage treatments occurred. In the second experiment, about 1700 free-living nematodes (100 ml soil)(-1) were found under conventional tillage without mulch while under reduced tillage with mulch their numbers were significantly higher at 3100 nematodes (100 ml soil)(-1). We conclude that an appropriate choice of subsidiary crops can be an important management factor for the long term sustainability of non-inversion tillage systems.","[Schmidt, Jan H.; Finckh, Maria R.; Hallmann, Johannes] Univ Kassel, Organ Agr Sci, Nordbahnhofstr 1a, D-37213 Kassel, Germany; [Hallmann, Johannes] Julius Kuhn Inst, Fed Res Ctr Cultivated Plants, Inst Epidemiol & Pathogen Diagnost, Toppheideweg 88, D-48161 Munster, Germany",Universitat Kassel; Julius Kuhn-Institut,"Schmidt, JH (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Organ Agr Sci, Nordbahnhofstr 1a, D-37213 Kassel, Germany.",jschmidt@agrar.uni-kassel.de,"Finckh, Maria/ABH-3204-2020","Finckh, Maria/0000-0003-2925-4058; Schmidt, Jan H./0000-0002-6904-6336",European Union [289277: OSCAR],European Union(European Commission),This work was financed by the European Union FP7 Project n.289277: OSCAR (Optimising Subsidiary Crop Applications in Rotations).

This conservation suggests the existence of universal evolutionary selection pressures associated with photosynthesis-the primary function of chloroplasts. The stark exceptions to this conservation occur in parasitic angiosperms, which have escaped the dominant model by evolving the capacity to obtain some or all of their carbon (and nutrients) from their plant hosts. The consequence of this evolution to parasitism is a relaxation of the evolutionary constraints associated with the need to maintain photosynthetic function, the very function that drove early stages of the ancient symbiotic relationship that produced the contemporary chloroplast. Extreme examples of reduction ism among parasitic angiosperms reveals major alterations in chloroplast function with the loss of photosynthetic capacity and, with that, massive alterations in chloroplast genome content. This review highlights emerging patterns in reported gene loss and gene retention in the chloroplast genomes of parasitic plants. Some gene losses appear to occur in the early stages of parasitic evolution, even before the loss of photosynthetic capacity, like the chlororespiratory (ndh) genes. This contrasts with unexpected gene retentions, like that of the rbcL gene responsible for photosynthetic carbon dioxide fixation, and belies current understanding of gene function. The review relates gene retention to current knowledge of protein function and gene processing that has implications to broader aspects of genome conservation in organelles.

However, regions providing such successive ecosystems are scarce. In France, the ?Landes de Gascogne? area provides such ecological shifts since a few ancient moorland, peatland and oak areas prior the afforestation with maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) 160 years ago still remain. Focusing on soil-borne parasites such as plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN), because forests were recently increasingly impacted by the introduction of intensive agriculture, this study is therefore aimed at comparing the diversity and the community patterns of these organisms at different scales (intra- and intersites) and between different successive ecosystems. The understory vegetation as well as the pedoclimatic characterization of the sampled sites were also considered. Common diversity indices were not impacted by this transition from ancient to past ecosystems. Although the most colonizer nematodes prevailed in all the ecosystems, PPN community structures significantly diverged between both ecosystems. In the logged pine forests, the sediment legacy could have primarily impacted the diversity. Moreover, the PPN diversity would mainly respond to the soil hydromorphicity that determined the associated understory vegetation. Consequently, a significant shift in community structure from moorlands to logged pine to logged pine forests was observed, regarding especially high pathogenic species such as Pratylenchus spp. Thus, analyzing PPN community structure highlights the PPN potential risk to consider during the introduction of intensive cropping systems.

These results are in agreement with findings reported recently for a related root parasite, Epifagus virginiana (dePamphilis and Palmer, 1990).

However, little is known about how parasites and their hosts shift in distribution, and niche overlap in response to global change remains unclear to date. Here, the potential distribution and habitat suitability of four endangered holoparasites and their primary hosts in northern China were predicted using MaxEnt based on occurrence records and bioclimatic variables. The results indicated that (1) Temperature annual range (Bio7) and Precipitation of driest quarter (Bio17) were identified as the common key climatic factors influencing distribution (percentage contribution > 10%) for Cynomorium songaricum vs. Nitraria sibirica (i.e., parasite vs. host); Temperature seasonality (Bio4) and Precipitation of driest month (Bio14) for Boschniakia rossica vs. Alnus mandshurica; Bio4 for Cistanche deserticola vs. Haloxylon ammodendron; Precipitation of warmest quarter (Bio18) for Cistanche mongolica vs. Tamarix ramosissima. Accordingly, different parasite-host pairs share to varying degree the common climatic factors. (2) Currently, these holoparasites had small suitable habitats (i.e., moderately and highly) (0.97-3.77%), with few highly suitable habitats (0.19-0.81%). Under future scenarios, their suitable habitats would change to some extent; their distribution shifts fell into two categories: growing type (Boschniakia rossica and Cistanche mongolica) and fluctuating type (Cynomorium songaricum and Cistanche deserticola). In contrast, the hosts' current suitable habitats (1.42-13.43%) varied greatly, with highly restricted suitable habitats (0.18-1.00%). Under future scenarios, their suitable habitats presented different trends: growing type (Nitraria sibirica), declining type (Haloxylon ammodendron) and fluctuating type (the other hosts). (3) The niche overlaps between parasites and hosts differed significantly in the future, which can be grouped into two categories: growing type (Boschniakia rossica vs. Alnus mandshurica, Cistanche mongolica vs. Tamarix ramosissima), and fluctuating type (the others). Such niche overlap asynchronies may result in severe spatial limitations of parasites under future climate conditions. Our findings indicate that climate factors restricting parasites and hosts' distributions, niche overlaps between them, together with parasitic species identity, may jointly influence the suitable habitats of parasitic plants. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the threatened holoparasites themselves in conjunction with their suitable habitats and the parasite-host association when developing conservation planning in the future.","[Lu, Xin; Jiang, Ruoyan; Zhang, Guangfu] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Jiangsu Key Lab Biodivers & Biotechnol, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Nanjing Normal University,"Zhang, GF (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Jiangsu Key Lab Biodivers & Biotechnol, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",zhangguangfu@njnu.edu.cn,,,investigation and monitoring of rare and endangered plants in Jiangsu;  [211100B52003],investigation and monitoring of rare and endangered plants in Jiangsu; ,This work was supported by investigation and monitoring of rare and endangered plants in Jiangsu (211100B52003).,,69,1,1,18,34,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Thus, the viability, germination, microstructure, and antioxidant enzyme activities of dehydrated parasitic loranthus seeds were investigated. Diverse organelles were degraded or deformed during dehydration treatments. Additionally, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities gradually decreased in response to desiccation stress. A proteomic analysis involving TMT-labeling and LC-MS/MS were performed. A total of 1479 proteins were identified, of which 141 were differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) at 16 and 36 h after initiating the dehydration treatments. A functional annotation based on gene ontology revealed that the DEPs were mainly localized in chloroplasts and were related to energy metabolism, responses to stimuli, and the regulation of biological processes. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis determined that several of the identified proteins were associated with signal transductions, photosynthesis, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. The results suggest that the efficient removal of excessive ROS amounts may be crucial for promoting parasitic loranthus seed germination under dehydration stress conditions. A series of candidate dehydration stress-related proteins were identified and may be relevant for enhancing the dehydration tolerance of the recalcitrant seeds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of recalcitrant parasitic loranthus seeds to dehydration via a proteomic analysis involving TMT-labeling.","[Pan, Limei; Wan, Lingyun; He, Lili; Song, Lisha; Long, Hairong; Ji, Xiaowen; Jiang, Ni; Huo, Juan; Wei, Shugen; Fu, Jine] Guangxi Bot Garden Med Plant, Nanning, Peoples R China",,"Wei, SG; Fu, JE (corresponding author), Guangxi Bot Garden Med Plant, Nanning, Peoples R China.",weishugen2@163.com; duanwei3014@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81660637, 81703649, 81860672, 81960695]; Guangxi Natural Science Foundation, China [2016GXNSFDA380012, 2017GXNSFDA198026, 2018GXNS-FAA281089]; Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants Research and Innovation Team Building Project [GYCH2019008]; Scientific research funding project of Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants [GYJ202012]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangxi Natural Science Foundation, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province); Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants Research and Innovation Team Building Project; Scientific research funding project of Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81660637, 81703649, 81860672, 81960695), the Guangxi Natural Science Foundation, China (2016GXNSFDA380012, 2017GXNSFDA198026, 2018GXNS-FAA281089), the Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants Research and Innovation Team Building Project (GYCH2019008) and the Scientific research funding project of Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants (GYJ202012).

Lathraea, a root parasite that grows in the soil, has retained a plastid genome in which the inverted repeat region (IR) is well conserved, with the exception of a short deletion in one of its extremities close to the large single copy region (LSC). Transcription of the 16S rRNA gene located in the IR was demonstrated, suggesting the functionality of the gene expression apparatus. Besides genes for ribosomal proteins (rps7 and rp120) and for the plastid-encoded subunits of RNA polymerase (rpoA, rpoB, rpoC1 and rpoC2) were amplified by PCR. The single copy regions which contain most of the bioenergetic genes are more divergent than the inverted repeat regions with deleted or strongly altered sequences. This is particularly noticeable in the small one (SSC) which contains, in land plants studied so far, ndh genes for subunits of an NAD(P)H dehydrogenase. Despite some large deletions in the LSC, PCR experiments have shown that some photosynthesis genes, either functional (rbcL) or not (atpB-E) have been maintained. In addition heterologous hybridizations demonstrate that some genes (psaA, psaB, psbC-D) not amplified by PCR have been retained, at least partially. Because the psbA gene, despite having been amplified by PCR, did not map to any location on the Lathraea plastid genome, it is suspected that this sequence has been incorporated in another genome. From these findings we conclude that Lathraea plastid DNA is altered to a lesser extent than in Epifagus, a member of the Orobanchaceae, whilst being very different from Cuscuta reflexa whose plastid DNA (ptDNA) still contains all the photosynthetic genes found in autotrophic angiosperms. The maintenance of an intact rbcL gene might be the reason (or one of the reasons) why Lathraea has retained a plastid genome, even if the function of Rubisco in its amyloplasts remains unclear.","UNIV NANTES,FAC SCI & TECH,LAB CYTOPATHOL VEGETALE,F-44072 NANTES 03,FRANCE",Nantes Universite,,,,,,,,,34,28,28,1,8,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0031-9317,,,PHYSIOL PLANTARUM,Physiol.

They can be categorized into root parasites and stem parasites in terms of parasitic sites or divided into hemiparasites and holoparasites according to the degree of nutritional dependence on their hosts via haustoria. However, little is known concerning distribution patterns of different parasitic plant types and their determinants, which may be helpful for effective management and ecological conservation. Here, we collated an updated checklist of parasitic angiosperms in China and examined the distribution pattern of the four types, and then performed multiple linear regression analysis and redundancy analysis of 22 influencing factors representing biotic, topographic, and climatic factors. There are 745 species of parasitic angiosperms in China, belonging to 50 genera and 12 families. Regarding root parasites, most appeared in the west of China than in the east; while stem parasites showed a broader north-south divide in distribution. Hemiparasites were fewer in the east and more in the southwest. However, holoparasites displayed a patchy distribution across China. The results of redundancy analysis (after eliminating multicollinearity effects) showed that explained variation of root parasites, stem parasites, and hemiparasites was 87.9%, 93.7%, and 87.0%, respectively; while that of holoparasites was only 57.8%. Therefore, the four types of parasitic angiosperms varied quite distinctly in terms of distribution patterns across China. Seed plant richness was one of the common leading factors affecting distributions of root parasites, stem parasites, and hemiparasites in China. Besides, the other major influencing factors were the maximum temperature of the warmest month (Bio5), temperature seasonality (Bio4) and precipitation of the warmest quarter (Bio18), and isothermality (Bio3), respectively. Additionally, the main factor affecting holoparasites' distribution was the temperature (Bio3). We found that different parasitic angiosperm types in China were mainly affected by the biotic factor, temperature, and precipitation. In addition, the whole flora of parasites was similar to root parasites and hemiparasites in distribution; nevertheless, its leading factors were the same as those of hemiparasites. Our findings reveal the various responses of different parasitic angiosperm types to the environmental changes across China. It probably comes down to the evolutionary relationships and life strategies among these different types. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

No such records have been recorded for Thonningia sanguinea (Balanophoraceae), a rare, cryptic, obligate holoparasitic plant endemic to tropical Africa. This study reports on its host range and preference in Southern Nigeria. Its presence and current distribution ranges were plotted from reconnaissance surveys conducted across selected forested areas in Southern Nigeria, comprising, national parks, forest reserves, and community-managed forests. To detect specific hosts, soil excavation leading from parasite to host was conducted The results showed a broad host range with a special preference for native trees and members of the Euphorbiaceae and Urticaceae. Among the common host trees were: Guarea cedrata (Meliaceae), Lophira data (Ochanaceae), Musanga cecropiodes (Urticaceae), Myrianthus arboreus (Urticaceae), and Ricinodendron heudelotii (Euphorbiaceae). Only Hevea brasiliensis and Theobroma cacao were of exotic origin. Lophira alata was the most susceptible infected host plant with a percentage infestation rate of 28.77, while Musanga cecropiodes had the highest percentage occurrence as host with 31.57 %. This finding could have significant implications on the conservation status of the plant, which accounting for current IUCN status is Not Evaluated (NE).

Rhizosphere samples were obtained from three treatments, viz. conservation (CA) and conventional maize (CTA) fields, as well as from natural veld (NV) areas (serving as the reference) adjacent to maize fields in South African production areas. Forty-nine nematode genera (12 plant-parasitic and 37 non-parasitic/beneficial) were identified. Prominence values (PV) showed that Rotylenchulus and Meloidogyne (in descending order) dominated in 50 g roots of all three treatments, Pratylenchus in 5 g roots, and Rotylenchulus and Scutellonema in 200 g soils from CA and CTA maize, as opposed to Helicotylenchus and Rotylenchulus in soils from NV. Pratylenchus abundance in 5 g roots was significantly higher in CA and CTA maize compared to NV, with the Shannon diversity index values (H') also being the highest for species of this genus in CA, followed by CTA and NV. Rotylenchulus abundance/50 g roots was significantly higher in CA compared to both CTA and NV, while Meloidogyne abundance/50 g roots did not differ significantly among the three treatments. For soil nematodes, the H' was highest for NV, but not significantly compared to CA and CTA. Ninety-one percent of beneficial nematode genera and families were associated with NV soils, generally with higher PV and significant higher abundance (for bacterivores and predators) and diversity (for bacterivores, omnivores and predators) compared to CA and CTA. Nonetheless, most soils from the three treatments represented resource-depleted soil nematode communities indicating that soil health should be improved by using strategies such as cover cropping, incorporation of organic materials and inclusion of crop rotation sequences using cultivars with poor-host status or resistance to the dominating, target plant-parasitic nematode species to enable sustainable crop production.

Detection of disrupted interactions often relies on anachronistic plant characteristics, such as spines in the absence of large herbivores or large fruit without dispersers. However, obvious anachronisms are relatively uncommon, and it can be difficult to prove a direct link between the anachronism and a particular faunal taxon. Analysis of coprolites (fossil feces) provides a novel way of exposing lost interactions between animals (depositors) and consumed organisms. We analyzed ancient DNA to show that a coprolite from the South Island of New Zealand was deposited by the rare and threatened kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), a large, nocturnal, flightless parrot. When we analyzed the pollen and spore content of the coprolite, we found pollen from the cryptic root-parasite Dactylanthus taylorii. The relatively high abundance (8.9% of total pollen and spores) of this zoophilous pollen type in the coprolite supports the hypothesis of a former direct feeding interaction between kakapo and D. taylorii. The ranges of both species have contracted substantially since human settlement, and their present distributions no longer overlap. Currently, the lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) is the only known native pollinator of D. taylorii, but our finding raises the possibility that birds, and other small fauna, could have once fed on and pollinated the plant. If confirmed, through experimental work and observations, this finding may inform conservation of the plant. For example, it may be possible to translocate D. taylorii to predator-free offshore islands that lack bats but have thriving populations of endemic nectar-feeding birds. The study of coprolites of rare or extinct taxonomic groups provides a unique way forward to expand existing knowledge of lost plant and animal interactions and to identify pollination and dispersal syndromes. This approach of linking paleobiology with neoecology offers significant untapped potential to help inform conservation and restoration plans.","[Wood, Jamie R.; Wilmshurst, Janet M.] Landcare Res, Canterbury 7640, New Zealand; [Worthy, Trevor H.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Holzapfel, Avi S.] Dept Conservat, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",Landcare Research - New Zealand; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Adelaide,"Wood, JR (corresponding author), Landcare Res, POB 40, Canterbury 7640, New Zealand.",woodj@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Wood, Jamie/A-9393-2008; Wilmshurst, Janet/O-8611-2019; Wilmshurst, Janet M/C-2209-2009; Cooper, Alan/E-8171-2012; Worthy, Trevor Henry/B-3781-2012; Wood, Jamie/AAU-5530-2021","Wood, Jamie/0000-0001-8008-6083; Wilmshurst, Janet/0000-0002-4474-8569; Wilmshurst, Janet M/0000-0002-4474-8569; Cooper, Alan/0000-0002-7738-7851; Worthy, Trevor Henry/0000-0001-7047-4680; ",Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund,Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)),"The New Zealand Department of Conservation provided permits to access and sample coprolites from Honeycomb Hill Caves.

Soil and breadfruit root samples were collected from plantings in residences, parks, schools, botanical gardens, and breadfruit orchards. Soil samples were processed by elutriation and centrifugation for nematode extraction. Roots were subjected to mist chamber extraction for 7 days. Seven different genera of plant-parasitic nematodes (Helicotylenchus, Meloidogyne, Mesocriconema, Paratylenchus, Pratylenchus, Rotylenchulus, and Tylenchorhynchus) and one unidentified taxon in Heteroderidae were found. Helicotylenchus dihystera, Rotylenchulus reniformis, Paratylenchus sp., Pratylenchus coffeae, Meloidogyne spp., and a Heteroderid were found on all islands surveyed. Helicotylenchus dihystera was the most frequent species encountered, occurring at 68% of sites surveyed and was the most widespread plant-parasitic nematode of breadfruit on Kaua'i. On Maui, H. dihystera, R. reniformis, and P. coffeae were found in 40% of the samples collected. Paratylenchus was the most common plant-parasitic nematode to the island of O'ahu and was detected in 86% of the samples. Meloidogyne spp. were found in 43% of breadfruit sites on Oah'u, and 23% and 20% of that on Kaua'i and Maui, respectively, but in low abundance on all islands. Soil samples yielded Mesocriconema at sites on Kaua'i and (Tabu, and Tylenchorhynchus on Oah'u. Plant-parasitic nematodes were absent from 12% of the locations surveyed. An unidentified nematode in the Heteroderidae was detected in samples from each island, all from botanical gardens.","[Lau, J-W; Wang, K-H; Sipes, B.

We sequenced and analyzed the genome of a new Wolbachia strain (wPpe) in the plant-parasitic nematode Pratylenchus penetrans. Phylogenomic analyses placed wPpe as the earliest diverging Wolbachia, suggesting two evolutionary invasions into nematodes. The next branches comprised strains in sap-feeding insects, suggesting Wolbachia may have first evolved as a nutritional mutualist. Genome size, protein content, %GC, and repetitive DNA allied wPpe with mutualistic Wolbachia, whereas gene repertoire analyses placed it between parasite (A, B) and mutualist (C, D, F) groups. Conservation of iron metabolism genes across Wolbachia suggests iron homeostasis as a potential factor in its success. This study enhances our understanding of this globally pandemic endosymbiont, highlighting genetic patterns associated with host changes. Combined with future work on this strain, these genomic data could help provide potential new targets for plant-parasitic nematode control.","[Brown, Amanda M.

Numerous plant parasitic nematodes attack pulse crops and the prominent among them are Meloidogyne spp., Heterodera spp. and Paratylenchus spp., the endoparasites, Rotylenchulus spp., the semi-endoparasites, and Tylenchorhynchus spp. and Helicotylenchus spp., the ectoparasites. These nematodes have diverse methods of attack. Meloidogyne causes galling on roots, accompanied by a change in cell morphology, leading to the formation of giant cells in the cortical region of root upon which they feed; Heterodera form syncytia in the steler region and have a pearly appearance on the root; Pratylenchus form necrotic lesions on the root; Rotylenchulus reniformis cause dirty root disease and the mature females attached to the roots have a kidney-like appearance (seen under a microscope), hence the name reniformis. Tylenchorhynchus and Helicotylenchus are ectoparasites, but are considered of lesser importance than endoparasites or semi-endoparasites. They cause mechanical injury by feeding primarily on the epidermal cells of roots. Host range, length of life cycle and soil temperature and moisture for survival vary with nematode genera and species. Economic Threshold Level (ETL) also varies from crop to crop, as for chickpea it is estimated 1-2 J(2) of M. incognita/cm3 of soil or 0.031 P. thornei/cm(3) of soil or 1 egg of H. ciceri/cm(3) of soil or 1 premature female of R. reniformis/gm of soil, whereas in the case of pigeonpea it is 1 J(2) of M. javanica/gm of soil or 1-2 J(2) of H. cajani/gm of soil or 1.4 premature female of R. reniformis/gm of soil. During parasitism, nematodes have an adverse effect on the normal physiology, growth and development of the host plant. Ultimate harm caused to pulse crops are in the form of reduction in yield and quality. Average yield losses caused due to plant parasitic nematodes on a worldwide basis have been estimated as 13.7% in chickpea, 13.2% in pigeonpea and 10.9% in common bean. Different approaches for the management of these nematode pests include cultural, biological, botanical, host plant resistance and chemicals. These approaches need to be tested by research workers to develop integrated nematode management (INM) strategies at farm level in order to achieve maximum yield and better quality of crop.","[Askary, Tarique Hassan] Sher E Kashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol, Div Entomol, Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir, India",Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences & Technology of Kashmir (SKUAST Kashmir),"Askary, TH (corresponding author), Sher E Kashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol, Div Entomol, Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",tariq_askary@rediffmail.com,"Askary, Tarique/AAF-9180-2021",,,,,,254,6,8,0,4,CABI PUBLISHING-C A B INT,WALLINGFORD,"CABI PUBLISHING, WALLINGFORD 0X10 8DE, OXON, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78064-696-1; 978-1-78064-694-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,239,274,,,,10.1079/9781780646947.0000,,36,Biodiversity Conservation; Plant Sciences,Book Citation Index  Science (BKCI-S),Biodiversity & Conservation; Plant Sciences,BJ9OH,,,,,2023-05-15,WOS:000429642200013,View Full Record in Web of Science

To fill the gap in availability of compiled plant growth-form data, we have assembled what is, to our knowledge, the largest global database on growth-form as a plant trait. We have, with extensive error checking and data synthesis, assembled a growth-form database from 163 data sources for 143,616 vascular plant species from 445 different plant families. This is 38.6% of the currently accepted vascular plant diversity. For our database, we have chosen seven categories to cover the majority of the diversity in plant growth forms: aquatic plants, epiphytes, hemiepiphytes, climbing plants, parasitic plants, holo-mycoheterotrophs, and freestanding plants. These categories were used because we were able to reconcile the wealth of existing definitions and types of growth-form information available globally to them clearly and unequivocally, and because they are complementary with existing databases. Plants in the database were designated into a category if their adult growth form fit the criterion. We make available two databases: first, the complete data set, including species for which there is currently conflicting information, and second, a consensus data set, where all available information supports one categorization. Of the plant species for which we found information, 103,138 (72%) are freestanding, 21,110 (15%) are epiphytes, and 4,046 (3%) are parasites. Our growth-form data can be used to produce useful summary statistics by clade. For example, current data suggests that half of pteridophytes are epiphytic, that all hemiepiphytes are eudicots, and that there are no parasitic monocots, gymnosperms, or pteridophytes. Growth form is a crucial piece of fundamental plant-trait data with implications for each species' ecology, evolution, and conservation, and thus this data set will be useful for a range of basic and applied questions across these areas of research.

Local factors, including increased mulch coverage, crop richness, and percent of non-crop areas, are predictors of increased PH abundance and aphid parasitism rates. Our findings support and strengthen previous findings in UA research. Urban farmers should be encouraged to diversify urban agroecosystem spatial composition and implement APM practices to reduce pest impacts. Urban agriculture is practiced in spatially fragmented landscapes with unique characteristics that can impact species occurrence in time and space. As a result, biological control services, an ecosystem service from naturally occurring arthropod natural enemies, can be negatively impacted. Many urban farms forgo pesticides and utilize agroecological pest-management strategies that rely on natural enemies to help regulate pest populations. Understanding how these enemies are affected by landscape composition and on-farm management practices is critical to understanding agroecological pest management in UA and furthering our understanding of landscape-mediated population dynamics. Over two growing seasons, we sampled brassica crops in urban agriculture sites occurring on a spectrum of surrounding landscape imperviousness, spatial composition, size, and management practices to better understand parasitic Hymenoptera abundance, richness, and parasitism rates on the common cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae). We found that on-farm agroecological pest-management practices such as mulch coverage, floral richness, and overall crop-plant richness impacted parasitic Hymenoptera abundance. Larger proportions of on-farm noncrop area increased parasitoid abundance on urban farms. Aphid parasitism increased in relation to on-farm management practices, including increased crop-plant richness. These findings add to a growing understanding of urban agroecosystem function and support the enemies hypothesis in urban agroecosystems.","[Arnold, Joshua Earl] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management ESPM, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Arnold, Joshua Earl] Warren Wilson Coll, Dept Environm Studies, Asheville, NC 28815 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Arnold, JE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management ESPM, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",joshua-arnold@warren-wilson.edu,,,University of California Berkeley's College of Natural Resources Robert van den Bosch Scholarship,University of California Berkeley's College of Natural Resources Robert van den Bosch Scholarship,This research was funded by the University of California Berkeley's College of Natural Resources Robert van den Bosch Scholarship.,,66,1,1,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,MAY,2022,13,5,,,,,,,467,10.3390/insects13050467,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects13050467,,,13,Entomology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Entomology,1O9AD,35621801,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-05-15,WOS:000801614500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although such hotspots have also been shown to be centres for terrestrial vertebrate endemism, much less is known about how well these areas function as hotspots for other less well-studied groups, including the hyperdiverse arthropods, other invertebrates and fungi. Because there is a close evolutionary and ecological relationship between insects and plants, we suggest that the potential role of plants as umbrella species for herbivorous insects, potentially herbivorous fungi and nematodes, and parasitic insects should be explored. Finally, we reflect on the increasing social, economic, human conflict and governance issues and the impacts of increasing land use change and global climate change that threaten the biodiversity hotspot system.","[Stork, Nigel E.] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Ctr, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Habel, Jan Christian] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Griffith University; Technical University of Munich,"Stork, NE (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Ctr, Griffith Sch Environm, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",nigel.stork@griffith.edu.au,"Habel, Jan Christian/H-2112-2019","Habel, Jan Christian/0000-0003-1378-9381; Stork, Nigel/0000-0001-7812-2452",,,,,90,33,34,3,106,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

The suitable habitat of this species is shrinking at a remarkable rate, although conservation measures have been implemented. Cistanche deserticola is an entirely parasitic herb that occurs in deserts, is a source of desert ginseng worldwide, and has extremely high medicinal value. Little is known about using niche models to simulate habitat suitability and evaluate important environmental variables related to parasitic species. In this study, we modeled the current suitable habitat of H. ammodendron and C. deserticola by MaxEnt based on occurrence record data of the distributions of these two species in China. We grouped H. ammodendron and C. deserticola into three groups according to the characteristics of parasitic species and modeled them with environmental factors. The results showed that bioclimate was the most important environmental parameter affecting the H. ammodendron and C. deserticola distribution. Precipitations, such as annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation in the driest quarter, were identified as the most critical parameters. The slope, diurnal temperature range, water vapor pressure, ground-frost frequency, and solar radiation also substantially contributed to the distribution of the two species. The proportions of the most suitable areas for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 1.2%, 1.3%, and 1.7%, respectively, in China. When combined with cultural geography, five hot spot conservation areas were determined within the distribution of H. ammodendron and C. deserticola. The comprehensive analysis indicated that by using MaxEnt to model the suitable habitat of parasitic species, we further improved the accuracy of the prediction and coupled the error of the distribution of a single species. This study provides a useful reference for the protection of H. ammodendron forests and the management of C. deserticola plantations.","[He, Ping; Li, Yunfeng; Xu, Ning; Meng, Fanyun] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing Key Iab Tradit Chinese Med Protect & Util, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Yunfeng; Xu, Ning; Meng, Fanyun] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Engn Res Ctr Nat Med, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Yunfeng] Chengde Med Coll, Dept Tradit Chinese Med, Key Lab Res & Dev Tradit Chinese Med Hebei Prov, Chengde, Peoples R China; [Peng, Cheng] Chengdu Univ TCM, Sch Pharm, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Chengde Medical University; Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,"Peng, C (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ TCM, Chengdu, Peoples R China.;Meng, FY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",pengchengchengdu@126.com; mfy@bnu.edu.cn,"CHENG, PENG/HNP-4206-2023","Peng, Cheng/0000-0003-3303-906X",Project of Hebei Administration of Traditional Chinese medicine [2017079]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81072999],Project of Hebei Administration of Traditional Chinese medicine; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Project of Hebei Administration of Traditional Chinese medicine, Grant/Award Number: 2017079; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 81072999",,145,2,2,5,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Also in ribosome-deficient bleached plastids, produced in leaves by experimental treatments or mutation, chloroplast DNA remains unaltered. The chloroplast DNA of various bleached mutant strains of Euglena has suffered major deletions or rearrangements, but is, however, never totally lost. Also leukoplasts of parasitic higher plants contain DNA. In the organellar DNA of several parasitic plants photosynthetic genes are conserved. In the heterotrophic flagellate Astasia and in the holoparasite Epifagus virginiana (Orobanchaceae) the size of the plastid DNA is greatly reduced by major deletions and most or all photosynthetic genes or genes related to the chloroplastic respiratory chain are lost. The residual plastid genomes have, however, retained genes for RNAs, tRNAs and ribosomal polypeptides and these are transcribed, although plastidic RNA-polymerase genes are lost in Epifagus. These findings demand the existence of a nuclear-encoded RNA-polymerase. The relevance of the conservation of plastid DNA and of plastidic gene expression in non-photosynthetic cells is discussed, remains, however, at present elusive.

Behavioural choice tests showed that male parasitoids were not attracted to any volatiles from plants infested by D. radicum or from nectar plants, while females showed clear attraction to both volatile sources. Young females were more attracted to combined volatiles of host and food plants over those from only the host plant, whereas older females showed no differences in attraction to the two odour sources. This suggests that intercropping attractive flowers with host plants could potentially be used to recruit newly emerged parasitoids from surrounding fields while older parasitoids invest more energy in host location than in additional food search. Volatiles from a whole infested plant were chosen over those emitted from separated above- and below-ground parts from infested plants. It is important to consider the availability of both energy and host resources for parasitoids when designing an eco-compatible management of a vegetable crop system.","[Nilsson, Ulf; Eriksson, Anna; Ramert, Birgitta; Anderson, Peter] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Plant Protect Biol, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Eriksson, Anna] Fdn Edmund Mach, Iasma Res & Innovat Ctr, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, Italy",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Fondazione Edmund Mach,"Nilsson, U (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Plant Protect Biol, POB 102, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",ulf.nilsson@slu.se,,,"Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas)","We thank Linda-Marie Rannback, Hasna Kaniz Mahbuba and Per Karlsson for help with rearing of insects and plants and for fruitful discussions.

This is especially true for the groups that include weedy or invasive species such as Cuscuta. While approximately half of the Cuscuta (dodders) species may require conservation measures, the genus as a whole is sometimes posted on governmental lists of noxious or quarantine weeds. Our study challenges this stereotype and uses the case of C. jepsonii (Jepson's dodder) to illustrate the precarious biodiversity and conservation status faced by many dodder species. Until now, Jepson's dodder has been known only from its type collection. Consequently, its phylogenetic affinities, morphological variation, and ecology have remained unknown, and the species is currently ambiguously considered either synonymous to the invasive North American weed C. indecora or to an extinct endemic from California. Using molecular data from newly found collections, we infer that C. jepsonii belongs to C. Californica species complex, instead of C. indecora clade. Also, we discuss the conservation of this species within the broader biological and ecological context of Cuscuta in general.","[Costea, Mihai] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Stefanovic, Sasa] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University; University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"Costea, M (corresponding author), Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Biol, 75 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",mcostea@wlu.ca,,,"NSERC of Canada Discovery [327013-06, 326439-06]",NSERC of Canada Discovery(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"The authors thank M.

Their own performance also strongly depends on interactions with host species. However, little is known about the roles of parasite genetic variation vs. plasticity in these interactions. We grew plants from eight maternal families of the root hemiparasite Rhinanthus alectorolophus with six potential host species (two grasses, two legumes and two forbs) and without a host and measured fitness-related and morphological traits of the parasite, host biomass and overall productivity. Parasite biomass and other traits showed strong plastic variation in response to different host species, but were also affected by parasite maternal family. Parasite seed families responded differently to the hosts, indicating genetic variation that could serve as the basis for adaptation to different host plants. However, there were no negative correlations in the performance of families across different hosts, indicating that R. alectorolophus has plastic generalist genotypes and is not constrained in its use of different host species by trade-offs in performance. Parasite effects on host biomass (which may indicate virulence) and total productivity (host + parasite biomass) depended on the specific combination of parasite family and host species. Mean biomass of hosts with a parasite family and mean biomass of that family tended to be negatively correlated, suggesting selection for maximum resource extraction from the hosts. Specialization of generalist root hemiparasites may be restricted by a lack of trade-offs in performance across hosts, together with strong spatial and temporal variation in host species availability. The genetic variation in the effects on different hosts highlights the importance of genetic diversity of hemiparasites for their effects on plant community structure and productivity and for the success of using them to restore grassland diversity. Root hemiparasites have green leaves but attack the roots of other plants and extract water and nutrients from them. Offspring of different mother plants of the root hemiparasite Rhinanthus alectorolophus varied in their response to several host plants and their damage to the hosts also depended on the specific combination of parasite family and host species. Our results suggest that genetic variation within populations of hemiparasites influences the interactions with their hosts. Genetic variation of hemiparasites will be important for their use to reduce productivity in the management of grasslands for conservation.","[Moncalvillo, Belen; Matthies, Diethart] Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, Plant Ecol, D-35043 Marburg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg,"Moncalvillo, B (corresponding author), Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, Plant Ecol, D-35043 Marburg, Germany.",moncalvi@biologie.uni-marburg.de,,,,,,,68,0,0,7,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,FEB 1,2023,15,2,,,,,,,plac063,10.1093/aobpla/plac063,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plac063,,,11,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,8I7YG,36751364,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-05-15,WOS:000921945700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Field plots were established on a diversified organic vegetable farm that had been under certification for 5 years and on a conventional pepper farm that had been fumigated with methyl bromide/chloropicrin and cropped annually to bell pepper for 25 years. The plot design was a split plot where the main treatment was the application of 67 t ha(-1) of urban plant debris (UPD), and sub plots were; (1) no-till production into residue remaining from a cover crop of Sunn Hemp (Crotalaria juncea), (2) or Iron-clay Pea (Vigna unguiculata), (3) creation of raised polyethylene-mulched beds and, (4) soil solarization for a 6-8 week period. Soil fumigation with methyl bromide/chloropicrin (67/33) was evaluated only at the conventional farm site. Experiments were conducted in 1999 and repeated in 2000. At the organic farm only Pythium root rot was identified whereas, at the conventional farm Phytophthora blight was the predominant soilborne disease. UPD application significantly reduced the incidence of Pythium root rot from 24.7% to 12.1% in 2000 at the organic site and the incidence of Phytophthora blight from 49.8% to 31.1% in 1999 at the conventional site. At the conventional site, Phytophthora blight was significantly lower in solarized (21.9%) and fumigated (22.1%) plots when compared to plots with untreated soil covered by polyethylene mulch (46.1%) in 1999. In 2000, Phytophthora blight was significantly higher in the no-till treatments (91.1-91.8%) when compared to the other soil management treatments (50.2-63.5%). UPD application significantly reduced the populations of plant parasitic nematodes from 64.5 to 37.5 per 100cm(3) soil in 2000 at the organic site and from 94.3 to 12.9 in 1999 at the conventional site, when compared to treatments not receiving UPD. At the organic site the populations of plant parasitic nematodes were significantly higher in the no-till Sunn Hemp plots than solarized plots. At the conventional site, significantly higher populations of Meloidogyne spp. were found in solarized and no-till Sunn Hemp treatments then in untreated soil covered with plastic mulch, while significant reductions in Meloidogyne spp. only occurred with soil fumigation. The results demonstrate that several nonchemical management practices can reduce the impact of soilborne pests for fresh market bell pepper production in a humid, subtropical climate.

It is essential to know what plant species a particular hemiparasitic species associates with in the field, in order to determine host plant preferences and to make broader inferences about host plants. Pedicularis lanceolata is a hemiparasite that is regionally rare in New England and the southeastern margins of its range, but more abundant in the core of its range in the Midwest. I sought to compare the species associated with P. lanceolata in the core and margins of its range to determine if marginal populations have different associates from core populations. I hypothesized that P. lanceolata may be rare in the eastern United States because it encounters fewer suitable associates, and potentially more competitive invasive species, at the margins of its range than at the center of its range. In each of 22 populations of P. lanceolata I recorded abundances of all vascular plants growing near five focal P. lanceolata individuals. Different suites of species co-occurred with P. lanceolata in different parts of its range, but there were no significant differences across its range in the percent covers of natives, non-native invasives, non-native non-invasives, or species with native and non-native genotypes. These results suggest that non-native invasive species do not pose greater threats to edge populations of P. lanceolata than to core populations. The data suggest that candidates for potential hosts include members of the Asteraceae and Poaceae, Cirsium discolor, Clematis virginiana, Comas 11111017711171, Eupatorium inoculation, E. perMiatum, Impatiens capensis, Lycopus uniflorus, and Vernonia gigantea.

In the face of habitat fragmentation and the recent extinction or decline of many marsupial species in southern Australia, addressing knowledge gaps on vertebrate vectors is critical to determine deficiencies in seed dispersal. Here we examine one potential dispersal vector for the seeds of Cassytha pubescens, a native hemi-parasitic vine that contributes to vegetation complexity within many woodland habitats in southern Australia that are threatened by fragmentation. To determine the potential dispersal role of mammals for Cassytha pubescens within southern Australian woodlands, we collected and examined 46 scat samples from the omnivorous, nationally endangered southern brown bandicoot, Isoodon obesulus, over two fruiting (summer) seasons. Of the 46 scats, five had up to six seemingly undigested seeds of C. pubescens, indicating that I. obesulus consumes the fruits and may act as a disperser for this vine. Our findings improve understanding of the role of marsupials like bandicoots in dispersing native plant seed and may help to inform conservation management priorities to protect ecosystem function more effectively in fragmented woodlands threatened by loss of vertebrate seed vectors.","[Maciunas, E.

Here we investigate the genetic structure of the annual hemiparasitic herb Rhinanthus angustifolius to evaluate the genetic distinctness of two currently described subspecies and three habitat-related groups of populations inferred from recent common-garden data. Data from 11 nuclear microsatellite loci, obtained from 17 southern Swedish populations of R. angustifolius, were analyzed with a variety of population genetic techniques to examine how intraspecific genetic structure relates to taxonomy, habitat and geography. Neither the two subspecies nor the three recently identified population groups formed genetically coherent lineages. Rather, there was a clear isolation-by-distance pattern, pointing to a major role of geographically restricted gene flow in structuring the diversity at the putatively neutral microsatellite loci. Although uncertainties remain regarding the influence of homoplasy and possible introgression from the closely related R. minor, our microsatellite data argue against the recognition of previously identified subspecies or population groups as management units for conservation purposes. As currently described entities do not contain much unique genetic variation, we recommend conserving populations from a large geographical range, rather than populations from specific habitats, to preserve the long-term evolutionary potential of the species.","[Jonstrup, Anneli; Andersson, Stefan; Hedren, Mikael] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Andersson, S (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers, Lund, Sweden.",stefan.andersson@biol.lu.se,"Andersson, Stefan/E-1349-2016","Andersson, Stefan/0000-0003-3828-5016",Kungliga Fysiografiska Sallskapet i Lund; Anna och Svante Murbecks minnesfond,Kungliga Fysiografiska Sallskapet i Lund; Anna och Svante Murbecks minnesfond,The work was supported by Kungliga Fysiografiska Sallskapet i Lund and Anna och Svante Murbecks minnesfond (to AJ).,,59,1,1,5,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0107-055X,1756-1051,,NORD J BOT,Nord.

Most parasitoid species visited a limited range of host plants, which may have implications for conservation biological control and conservation biology.","Univ Illinois, Dept Entomol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Tooker, JF (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Entomol, 320 Morrill Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,"Tooker, John/P-6421-2014","Tooker, John/0000-0002-9303-6699",,,,,28,47,51,2,31,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0013-8746,,,ANN ENTOMOL SOC AM,Ann.

From a disease perspective, crop rotation is one of the best control measures in no-tillage systems, as many diseases are stubble-borne. A long-term no-tillage systems experiment was conducted from 2007 to 2016 in Western Australia to test effects of crop rotation and residue amount on soil health, crop growth and yield. The current research focusses on the progression of the main stubble-borne and root diseases and plant-parasitic nematodes in this experiment. The research compared a diverse crop rotation with a 'typical' farmer rotation, a cereal rotation and wheat monoculture. Three-year rotations were used and the crops and cultivars were changed periodically, within the rotations, to ensure they were relevant to farmers. Levels of root lesion nematode (Pratylenchus neglectus) and Pythium increased most in the pasture and diverse rotations, followed by the wheat monoculture and appeared to decrease slightly in the farmer and cereal rotations. The combination of canola and wheat, along with susceptible chickpea, appeared to favour root lesion nematode. In contrast, fallow and lupin in the farmer rotation appeared most effective at reducing levels. The relatively high numbers of P. neglectus in the pasture was likely due to continuous presence of a number of susceptible weeds and subterranean clover. The crop selections in the diverse rotation of this experiment have generally been a poor choice in terms of P. neglectus, the main nematode threat in Western Australia. By 2016, there was significantly greater Rhizoctonia solani in the soil following cereals compared with canola, chickpea and fallow. Nonetheless, the break crops appeared to have had a relatively short term effect on amounts of R. solani. Over the nine years, Fusarium spp. DNA in the soil increased most in the cereal rotation and wheat monoculture; it hardly changed in the farmer rotation and pasture and it declined in the diverse rotation. There was a decrease in Didymella pinodes/Phoma medicaginis var pinodella DNA (causing pea black spot) in the cereal rotation, farmer rotation and wheat monoculture. In contrast, there was a small increase in pea black spot pathogen DNA in the diverse rotation. This generally reflected the number of pea crops grown, except for the farmer rotation, which had peas grown at the same intensity as the diverse rotation. The difference between these two rotations was likely due to the lower amounts of residue in the farmer rotation, which had fallow and tillage since 2013. As expected, there were higher incidence of the stubble-borne disease in wheat and barley when following the same type of crop. Crop residue management, by windrow burning, had little effect on the level of leaf, root or crown diseases. The differences in host status between crop types and even varieties means that farmers require up-to-date information on the host status if rotations are going to be effective in reducing a broad range of plant-parasitic nematodes and pathogens in soils with no-tillage.","[Flower, K.

It is morphologically very similar to R. manillana from nearby Samar. This study aims to contribute to the taxonomy and conservation of R. lagascae and R. manillana (i.e. the R. lagascae complex) by resolving their patterns of genetic diversity and structure. The results of analyses of a microsatellite data set indicate that despite their frequently extremely small sizes and geographic isolation, Rafflesia populations display moderate genetic diversity and do not show evidence of pronounced inbreeding. Most populations appear to have limited gene flow among them. Patterns of genetic diversity of staminate and pistillate Rafflesia flowers growing on the same Tetrastigma host plants indicate that the R. lagascae complex is monoecious and that host plants are regularly infected by multiple Rafflesia plants. PCoA and Bayesian cluster analyses show that the complex is composed of three genetically isolated taxa. One of these constitutes R. manillana, supporting the morphology-based hypothesis that it is taxonomically distinct from R. lagascae. The second taxon in this complex is composed of a morphologically cryptic R. lagascae population from Mt. Labo, which is genetically distinct from all remaining R. lagascae populations that were studied and that form the third taxon. We recommend that these three taxa are managed as different conservation entities.","[Pelser, Pieter B.; Barcelona, Julie F.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Nickrent, Daniel L.] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 1125 Lincoln Dr, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Gemmill, Chrissen E.

Here, we present the first successful, quantified field trial to establish from seed populations of dactylanthus (Dactylanthus taylorii, Mystropetalaceae), a threatened New Zealand endemic root-holoparasitic angiosperm. Establishment was monitored at four sites at Waipapa, Pureora Forest Park. The impact of two different sowing methods (broad- and central-sown), canopy state (as a proxy for soil moisture levels) and three dominant host species were tested. Establishment of dactylanthus was confirmed in 22 out of 24 plots 10 years after sowing, with earliest emergence after 4 years. Average and maximum inflorescence numbers per plot were similar to those of protected wild populations. The only open-canopy site performed worse in comparison with a closed-canopy site sharing the same dominant host species; differences in root availability and survival of the desiccation-sensitive seeds were regarded as the most likely explanations. Host species dominance had a significant impact on inflorescence numbers, indicating host preference in the species despite a wide host range. In contrast to longer-established wild populations, most of which are male-biased, female inflorescences strongly outnumbered males, considered as evidence of environmental sex determination and sex-switching of individuals. Findings from this study have increased our knowledge of the biology of dactylanthus, confirmed translocation as an effective tool in the conservation of the species and should be applicable for the protection of threatened parasitic plants species elsewhere in the world.","[Holzapfel, Sebastian Avi] Sci & Tech Grp, Dept Conservat, Private Bag 3072, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Dodgson, John] 71 C Waiwera St, Kawhia 3889, Te Awamutu, New Zealand; [Rohan, Maheshwaran] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Holzapfel, SA (corresponding author), Sci & Tech Grp, Dept Conservat, Private Bag 3072, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",aholzapfel@doc.govt.nz,,,,,,,60,6,7,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,FEB,2016,217,2,,,,,127,138,,10.1007/s11258-015-0556-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-015-0556-7,,,12,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,DK0HJ,,hybrid,,,2023-05-15,WOS:000374593200002,View Full Record in Web of Science
