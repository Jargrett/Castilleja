(Scrophulariaceae),JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Schwalbea americana; hemiparasite; endangered species; host preference; optimal host; Scrophulariaceae,PLANT; PHYSIOLOGY; GROWTH,"We examined the host-preference and optimal hosts of the federally endangered hemiparasite, Schwalbea americana L. We also determined the effects of four fertilizer treatments (NO3-140ppmN, NO3-280ppmN, NH4-140ppmN, and NH4-280ppmN) on the formation of haustoria of S. americana to two of these host species, Panicum tenue and Pityopsis graminifolia. Results of the host preference study show that Schwalbea americana seedlings are more likely to form haustorial connections with Pityopsis graminifolia and Ilex glabra than with other common associates. We also found that size of Schwalbea americana seedlings played an important role in year to year survivorship independent of host attachment. Regardless of nitrogen form, we observed a greater rate of attachment of Schwalbea americana to Pityopsis graminifolia than to Panicum tenue. Nitrogen treatment had no effect on parasitism of Panicum tenue, although more seedlings of Schwalbea americana survived without haustoria with the NH4-280ppm treatment. Growth (leaf area and stem height) of Schwalbea americana increased with NH4-280 ppm treatment with Pityopsis graminifolia as a host. Panicum tenue had much higher nitrate reductase activity levels in the leaf tissue than Pityopsis graminifolia, and both hosts showed low levels in the root tissue. Low levels of nitrate reductase activity were found in the leaves of Schwalbea americana. Host preference of Schwalbea americana may be related to the host's ability to utilize NH4 as opposed to its ability to reduce NO3. Growth of Schwalbea americana appears to be influenced by the amount of NH4 available to the host.","JW Jones Ecol Res Ctr, Newton, GA USA; Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol, Norfolk, VA 23508 USA",Old Dominion University,"Helton, RC (corresponding author), Atlanta Bot Garden, 1345 Piedmont Ave NE, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA.",,,,,,,,22,6,6,0,10,TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0040-9618,,,J TORREY BOT SOC,J.

Current approaches to measure host range are sensitive to sampling effort, the number of known hosts increasing with more records. Here, we develop a novel application of results-based stopping rules to determine how many hosts should be sampled to yield stable estimates of the number of primary hosts within regions, then use species richness estimation to predict host ranges of parasites across their distributional ranges. We selected three mistletoe species (hemiparasitic plants in the Loranthaceae) to evaluate our approach: a strict host specialist (Amyema lucasii, dependent on a single host species), an intermediate species (Amyema quandang, dependent on hosts in one genus) and a generalist (Lysiana exocarpi, dependent on many genera across multiple families), comparing results from geographically-stratified surveys against known host lists derived from herbarium specimens. The results-based stopping rule (stop sampling bioregion once observed host richness exceeds 80% of the host richness predicted using the Abundance-based Coverage Estimator) worked well for most bioregions studied, being satisfied after three to six sampling plots (each representing 25 host trees) but was unreliable in those bioregions with high host richness or high proportions of rare hosts. Although generating stable predictions of host range with minimal variation among six estimators tri-ailed, distribution-wide estimates fell well short of the number of hosts known from herbarium records. This mismatch, coupled with the discovery of nine previously unrecorded mistletoe-host combinations, further demonstrates the limited ecological relevance of simple host-parasite lists. By collecting estimates of host range of constrained completeness, our approach maximises sampling efficiency while generating comparable estimates of the number of primary hosts, with broad applicability to many host parasite systems.

Parasitic interactions are among the most common species interaction types, and analysis of parasite-host ranges can advance understanding of how host-parasite pairs structure community interactions across their geographic distributions. Using network analysis and host preference relative index, we analysed host use by the South American mistletoe, Tristerix corymbosus (Loranthaceae), in 22 localities among two biomes: Chilean matorral and temperate forest. The total number of host species recorded was 27, and 40% of these species were non-native. The non-native Populus sp. was shared between biomes. There was a positive relationship between host range and potential host species richness at the studied localities. On average, the mistletoe parasitized each host species relative to its abundance. However, some host species in some localities are more parasitized than expected. Network structure showed a differences in host use between the two biomes: Aristotelia chilensis was central in the temperate forest, with Populus sp. in the Chilean matorral. Host use intensity in the Chilean matorral was higher for non-native species. Tristerix corymbosus has a wide host range and could be considered a generalist parasite across its full geographic distribution, but at local scales, host preferences differed among localities and are related to host coverage. Alterations in community composition, due to natural events or human activities, can modify the availability of possible hosts. Hence, the mistletoe with the described characteristics may be able to change its infection preference while maintaining the interaction functionality.","[Atencio, N. O.; Vidal-Russell, R.; Amico, G.

Little, however, is known about that of the hemiparasite Pedicularis. It is essential to understand the host dependence and preference of Pedicularis for successful cultivation of plants in this genus and for understanding the roles they play in natural communities. We tested the effects of two herbaceous host species (Trifolium repens and Polypogon monspeliensis) on the survival and growth performance of Pedicularis cephalantha. Five P. cephalantha seedlings and two host plants were planted in each pot. In the control, no host plants were planted (treatment 1). Host plants were planted in three combinations: only T. repens (treatment 2) or P. monspeliensis (treatment 3) or a mixture of both (treatment 4). The results showed that P. cephalantha performed better in the presence of host plants, and host plants are more essential to P. cephalantha for proper development than for survival. The grass host P. monspeliensis proved to be a better host plant for P. cephalantha than the legume host T. repens. The high dependence of P. cephalantha on host plants and its host preference were demonstrated in this study. This is the first report of the performance of Chinese Pedicularis species in cultivation throughout all life stages (from seeds to seeds).","[Ren, Yong-Quan; Guan, Kai-Yun; Li, Ai-Rong; Hu, Xiao-Jian; Zhang, Le] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming 650204, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Ren, Yong-Quan; Hu, Xiao-Jian; Zhang, Le] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Guan, KY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming 650204, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",guanky@mail.kib.ac.cn,"Li, Ai-Rong/M-1858-2013","Li, Ai-Rong/0000-0002-6134-9471; Ren, Yongquan/0000-0002-0129-435X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [30670207, 30970288]; National Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province [2009CD114]; Chinese Academy of Sciences",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"We are grateful to Jing-Xiu Li, Xue-Qing Yin, Nan Jiang and Li-Hua Yang from KIB for their assistance with experiments.

Root hemiparasites are common components of many ecosystems and can affect both the biomass and the nutritional quality of the plants they infect. The consequences of these modifications for the preference and performance of three herbivore feeding guilds sharing a host with the hemi-parasite were examined. 2. It was predicted that as the hemiparasite increased in biomass its impact on the host would increase, as would the indirect impacts on the herbivores. It was also predicted that herbivores from different feeding guilds would respond differently to the presence of the hemiparasite, reflecting the extent to which they utilise resources disrupted by the parasite and hence are in competition with it. 3. The preference and performance of phloem-feeding aphids, xylem-feeding spittle bugs, and leaf-feeding grasshoppers were measured on the host grass species, Holcus lanatus L. (Poaceae), with and without attachment from the hemi-parasite, Rhinanthus minor L. (Orobanchaceae). 4. The effects of R. minor on the host were dependent on the hemiparasite's stage of growth, being most pronounced when it was at peak biomass. At this stage it caused a significant reduction in the biomass, water content, and total nitrogen content of the host plants. 5. Overall, herbivores benefited from, or preferred, shared host plants more than uninfected plants. The aphid benefited from sharing a host with R. minor, showing increased population growth on, and preference for, parasitised plants. The spittle bug also showed a preference for parasitised plants. The grasshopper, Chorthippus brunneus Thunberg (Orthoptera: Acrididae), did not show a preference for, or a performance response to, parasitised hosts, but it consumed significantly more plant material when caged on parasitised plants. 6. These data support the prediction that invertebrate herbivores responded to changes in host plant traits driven by the hemiparasite, and strongly suggest that these indirect interactions could impact on population and community processes within natural communities.","[John, Elizabeth A.] Lincoln Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fac Agr Food & Anim Sci, Lincoln LN2 2LG, England; [Ewald, Naomi C.; John, Elizabeth A.; Hartley, Susan E.] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Hartley, Susan E.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Lincoln; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Sussex; N8 Research Partnership; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; White Rose University Consortium; University of York - UK,"John, EA (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fac Agr Food & Anim Sci, Riseholme Pk, Lincoln LN2 2LG, England.",ljohn@lincoln.ac.uk,,"John, Elizabeth/0000-0001-9281-536X; Hartley, Sue/0000-0002-5117-687X",Natural Environment Research Council [NE/D012333/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/D012333/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/D012333/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),We are grateful to Diane Ellis and Martyn Stenning for technical help and to the Natural Environment Research Council for financial support (NE/D012333/1).

Although the physiology of Thesium has been well studied in attempts to control its weedy habit, there have been few ecological investigations of its parasitic life history. Thesium chinense is thought to parasitize species of Poaceae, but evidence remains circumstantial. Methods A vegetation survey was conducted to test whether any plant species occurs significantly more often in plots with T. chinense than expected. In addition, haustorial connections were examined directly by excavating the roots and post-attachment host selectivity was evaluated by comparing the observed numbers of haustoria on different hosts against those expected according to the relative below-ground biomass. Haustorium sizes were also compared among host species. Key Results Only two of the 38 species recorded, Lespedeza juncea and Eragrostis curvula, occurred more often in plots with Thesium than expected. In contrast to this, T. chinense parasitized 22 plant species in 11 families, corresponding to 57.9 % of plant species found at the study site. Haustoria were non-randomly distributed among host species, suggesting that there is some post-attachment host selectivity. Thesium chinense generally preferred the Poaceae, although haustoria formed on the Fabaceae were larger than those on other hosts. Conclusions This is the first quantitative investigation of the host range and selectivity of hemiparasitic plants of the Santalales. The preference for Fabaceae as hosts may be linked to the greater nutrient availability in these nitrogen-fixing plants.","[Suetsugu, Kenji] Kyoto Univ, Fac Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Kawakita, Atsushi; Kato, Makoto] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",Kyoto University; Kyoto University,"Suetsugu, K (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Fac Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kitashirakawa Oiwake Cho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",kennji@seibutu.mbox.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Suetsugu, Kenji/S-8762-2018","Suetsugu, Kenji/0000-0002-7943-4164",,,,,42,33,41,4,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Host specificity and geography may play important roles in shaping the population structure of S. hermonthica, with the Rift Valley potentially presenting a significant barrier to dispersal. Genetic diversity was assessed in 12 S. hermonthica populations from locations in Ethiopia. Of these, seven populations were parasitic on sorghum, two each on tef and maize, and one on finger millet. Genetic variation was detected using four amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primer combinations. After correcting for repeatability, 385 fragments were detected across all primer combinations. The percentage of polymorphic loci was relatively high, ranging from 53.2% to 76.4%. Expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.168 to 0.279. Genetic differentiation between populations was relatively high, and all populations were significantly different from each other. FST values ranged from 0.032 to 0.293 and averaged 0.146. Genetic differences between populations could not be attributed to host specificity. Instead, geography was the main determinant of population structure. There was a correlation between geographic and genetic distance. A significant portion of the genetic variance could be apportioned on either side of the Rift Valley (5%; P = 0.001).

Blake (eared false-foxglove) (Orobanchaceae), an annual hemiparasitic plant, with potential host species. The two main objectives were (1) to determine host preference of the Illinois, USA, threatened plant, and (2) to determine percent seed germination and percent seedling survival in the presence of different potential host species. Overall, seed germination and seedling survivorship were very low. Agalinis auriculata had the highest seed germination and seedling survivorship, but produced no haustoria, when grown in pots with Sporobolus heterolepis (Gray) Gray. Haustorial development, as well as flower and fruit production, occurred when A. auriculata seedlings were paired with Helianthus occidentalis Riddell, Silphium terebinthinaceum Jacq., and Solidago rigida L. Flowers and fruits, however, were also produced by A. auriculata seedlings grown in pots with no host plant and in pots with a host plant but no haustorial development. This suggests that A. auriculata is a facultative hemiparasitic species.

It is essential to know what plant species a particular hemiparasitic species associates with in the field, in order to determine host plant preferences and to make broader inferences about host plants. Pedicularis lanceolata is a hemiparasite that is regionally rare in New England and the southeastern margins of its range, but more abundant in the core of its range in the Midwest. I sought to compare the species associated with P. lanceolata in the core and margins of its range to determine if marginal populations have different associates from core populations. I hypothesized that P. lanceolata may be rare in the eastern United States because it encounters fewer suitable associates, and potentially more competitive invasive species, at the margins of its range than at the center of its range. In each of 22 populations of P. lanceolata I recorded abundances of all vascular plants growing near five focal P. lanceolata individuals. Different suites of species co-occurred with P. lanceolata in different parts of its range, but there were no significant differences across its range in the percent covers of natives, non-native invasives, non-native non-invasives, or species with native and non-native genotypes. These results suggest that non-native invasive species do not pose greater threats to edge populations of P. lanceolata than to core populations. The data suggest that candidates for potential hosts include members of the Asteraceae and Poaceae, Cirsium discolor, Clematis virginiana, Comas 11111017711171, Eupatorium inoculation, E. perMiatum, Impatiens capensis, Lycopus uniflorus, and Vernonia gigantea.

Because of its parasitic nature and high fecundity, P. viscosa may well become a major plant invader with a significant impact on floodplain ecosystems. Thus, a knowledge of the host selectivity of P. viscosa will not only provide basic biological information, but will also contribute to the understanding of floodplain vegetation conservation. We evaluated the host selectivity by comparing the observed numbers of haustoria with those expected from the relative below-ground biomass. In addition, we examined the haustorial anatomy to determine whether haustoria are functional, and compared the above-ground biomass of three functional plant groups (grasses, legumes and nonleguminous forbs) in intact and parasite removal quadrats. We found that haustoria were nonrandomly distributed amongst host species, suggesting host preference for Poaceae and Fabaceae. In addition, haustoria attached to certain forbs did not penetrate into the stele. The above-ground biomass of grasses and legumes was increased significantly by the removal of P. viscosa, but the biomass of forbs did not change significantly. These results suggest that host preference depresses the performance of Poaceae and Fabaceae, thus affecting the competitive relationships among plants, meaning that P. viscosa may pose a serious threat to indigenous endangered legumes and grasses.

The reasons for the marked difference in growth performance of hemiparasites when attached to different hosts are not fully understood. In this study, the hypothesis was tested that hemiparasites showing a preference for different hosts have different nutrient requirements. Two facultative root hemiparasitic Pedicularis species (P. rex and P. tricolor) with a different host dependency and preference were used to test their responses to inorganic solutes. The effects of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium on growth of the hemiparasitic plants not attached to a host were determined, using an orthogonal design in pot cultivation under greenhouse conditions. Variables including biomass, shoot nutrient concentration, root:shoot (R:S) ratios and the number of haustoria were measured. As in autotrophic plants, nutrient deficiency reduced dry weight (DW) and nutrient concentrations in the root hemiparasites. Nitrogen and phosphorus significantly influenced growth of both Pedicularis species, while potassium availability influenced only shoot DW of P. rex. Nitrogen had far more effect on growth of P. rex than on P. tricolor, while phosphorus deficiency caused more marked growth depression in P. tricolor than in P. rex. Pedicularis rex grew faster than P. tricolor in a range of nutrient supplies. Different patterns of biomass allocation between the two Pedicularis species were observed. While P. rex invested more into roots (particularly fine rootlets) than P. tricolor, the number of haustoria produced by P. rex was relatively much lower than that produced by P. tricolor, which had a much smaller root system. The two Pedicularis species differ in nutrient requirements and biomass allocation. Distinct interspecific traits in growth and nutrient requirements can be driving forces for the differential interactions between hemiparasites and their hosts.","[Li, Ai-Rong; Li, Yun-Ju; Guan, Kai-Yun] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Econ Plants & Biotechnol, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; [Li, Ai-Rong; Smith, Sally E.; Smith, F.

We evaluated its host preference among species of the plant community, taking into account the abundance and foliage cover of the hosts. The importance of each species in the community and the mortality caused by the parasite were assessed based on a quantitative survey in 10 strips measuring 1m x 50m. The 10,290 individuals belonged to 42 species. Only 15 had a relative abundance in the plant community greater than 1%, of which 12 showed vestiges of parasitism. More than 80% of deaths in the community were associated with parasitism. Non-infected individuals had significantly less mortality rates (7%) than those infected (83%) (x(2) = 1102.4, df = 1, p < 0.001). The observed infestation was different from the expected both regarding relative host abundance (x(2) = 714.2, df = 11, p< 0.001) and foliage cover (x(2) = 209.2, df = 11, p< 0.001). Struthanthus flexicaulis preferred Mimosa calodendron, a legume attractive to avian seed dispersers. The interaction is maintained and intensified not only by the birds, who deposit innumerous seeds on the hosts branches, but also very likely by the ability of M. calodendron to fix nitrogen, thereby enhancing the mistletoe's development.","[Mourao, Fabiana Alves; Pereira Pinheiro, Rafael Barros; Jacobi, Claudia Maria; Cortes Figueira, Jose Eugenio] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Biol Geral, Inst Ciencias Biol, Av Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Mourao, FA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Biol Geral, Inst Ciencias Biol, Av Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",fabimourao@gmail.com,"Pinheiro, Rafael/C-9721-2016; Jacobi, Claudia M/B-7510-2013; PINHEIRO, RÔMULO PEDROZA/J-9992-2012; Côrtes-Figueira, José Eugênio/D-3933-2016","Pinheiro, Rafael/0000-0003-2342-8483; PINHEIRO, RÔMULO PEDROZA/0000-0002-0623-3003; Côrtes-Figueira, José Eugênio/0000-0001-6399-2025",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); CNPq,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"Research funding was provided by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) and Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG).

We conducted a vegetation survey and tested whether some plant species occur significantly more often in plots with Thesium spp. than expected, thereby representing potential hosts of the parasites. To test if the potential hosts are the species to which Thesium is physically attached, we also conducted an excavating and sowing experiment. We found a positive association with surrounding species for T. linophyllon, but not for the other two species. The number of haustoria of T. linophyllon attached to roots of host species was significantly affected by the number of roots of the surrounding species and by their identity (species, family and plant group). Thesium was, however, attached to 94% of all species occurring in the plots. We suggest that Thesium spp. do not specifically select hosts, but rather occur in microhabitats with specific conditions. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that there were differences in the microhabitats with and without Thesium and that germination of Thesium in the sowing experiment was higher in pots without any host.

We sampled a total of 666 trees in the study site and 118 individuals (17.7%) hosted S. aff. polyanthus. The abundance of mistletoe was significantly affected by the bark type, but not by the twigs inclination. In the cerrado, S. aff. polyanthus seems to be a generalist, with a tendency to be more common on some hosts (Kielmeyera coriacea, Pouteria ramiflora and Styraxjerrugineus), prefering that with rough bark type.

While recent studies have assessed host preferences of parasitic plants, how root-exuded chemicals can mediate host tropism and selection by root-parasitic plants is poorly understood. Under greenhouse conditions, we performed two pot experiments to determine whether the root parasite Santalum album selectively forages for superior hosts (N-2-fixing Acacia confusa Merr. or Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen) rather than for inferior hosts (non-N-2-fixing Bischofia polycarpa (levl.) Airy Shaw or Dracontomelon duperreranum Pierre), and whether S. album uses host root exudates and/or specific chemicals in these root exudates to locate and trigger haustorium formation. Lateral roots and haustoria of S. album seedlings exhibited greater growth in the direction of D. odorifera roots than toward roots from the other three hosts. Comparative metabolic analysis revealed that D. odorifera root exudates were enriched in isoflavonoid, flavonoid and flavone/flavonol biosynthesis pathways, and that the relative contents of flavonoids were significantly greater in the root exudates of D. odorifera than in those of the other three hosts. Root exudates from D. odorifera significantly promoted S. album root growth, haustorium formation and reactive oxygen species accumulation in haustoria. Our results demonstrate that the key step in plant parasitism by S. album is based on root exudation by a host plant; the exudates function as a metabolite signal that activate lateral root growth and haustorium formation. Our results also indicate that flavonoids in the root exudates could play an important role in S. album foraging activity. Information on the responses of root parasites to host root exudates and/or haustorium-inducing chemicals may be useful for selecting superior host species to plant with valuable species of root parasites.","[Li, Zhenshuang; Meng, Sen; Qin, Fangcuo; Wang, Shengkun; Liang, Junfeng; Lu, Junkun] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Trop Forestry, State Key Lab Tree Genet & Breeding, 682 Guangshan 1st Rd, Beijing 510520, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Xinhua] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [He, Xinhua] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, One Shield Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Tropical Forestry, CAF; State Key Laboratory of Tree Genetics & Breeding, CAF; University of Western Australia; University of California System; University of California Davis","Lu, JK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Trop Forestry, State Key Lab Tree Genet & Breeding, 682 Guangshan 1st Rd, Beijing 510520, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zhenshuangli@caf.ac.cn; mengsen021124@126.com; qinfc_001@163.com; wskun2001@163.com; jfliang2000@163.com; xinhua.he@uwa.edu.au; junkunlu@caf.ac.cn,"He, Xinhua/B-8047-2015","He, Xinhua/0000-0002-5570-3454",,,,,68,1,1,24,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1093/treephys/tpac116,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpac116,,OCT 2022,14,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,6Q3XK,36209450,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000891547600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, populations of O. minor show host specificity at a local level. Our previous work identified the potential for host specificity to act as a catalyst for genetic divergence among populations of O. minor. Here we have extended this investigation by sampling populations from multiple hosts, across a broad geographic range. Sequence characterised amplified region (SCAR) data identified an exotic host-generalist lineage and a native host-specialist lineage of O. minor, suggesting genetic structure in this species is defined by both host specificity and geography. In addition, host-range overlap, discordant tree topologies, and cryptic morphology indicate the presence of gene flow between alien races and endemic populations. Therefore, repeated introductions of alien races of O. minor from disparate sources leading to introgression with native populations, and cryptic race formation, seem to have contributed to the taxonomic confusion associated with this species. We speculate that radiations associated with broad host range and divergent host ecologies may have promoted the unusually wide geographic distribution and diversification of this species. Finally, evidence of multiple shifts to exotic hosts, coupled with the predicted northward shift in climatic suitability, identify the potential for range expansion in alien races of O. minor, which may threaten nationally scarce native taxa with genetic assimilation. Our phylogenetic analysis provides a framework for identifying host races in Orobanche with a view to setting conservation priorities.","[Thorogood, Chris J.; Hiscock, S.

Specifically, we compared the species composition, density and host specificity of psylloids or jumping plant lice (Hemiptera: Psylloidea), inhabiting hemiparasitic box mistletoe Amyema miquelii, and three of its host Eucalyptus species: Eucalyptus blakelyi, Eucalyptus melliodora and Eucalyptus polyanthemos. Insects were sampled by restricted canopy fogging in remnant Eucalyptus woodlands in an agricultural region of temperate south-eastern Australia. Although most psylloids are understood to be mono- or oligophagous, most species in our survey were found on the foliage of both mistletoes and eucalypts. Nevertheless, analysis of density patterns and reference to previous work on psylloids supports the high degree of host specificity for psylloids, leading to distinct assemblages on these two intimately associated plants. We show that (1) there were two mistletoe-associated species of psylloid and 18 eucalypt-associated species; (2) there were a large number of tourist species, as indicated by known psylloid/plant host associations; and (3) psylloid density was higher on eucalypt than mistletoe leaves. The different psylloid assemblages found on box mistletoes compared with their host plants are likely to be due to differences in the foliar properties implicated in host specificity and host selection by phytophagous insects. Further research is required to understand the ecological dynamics and evolutionary origins of these arboreal assemblages.","[Burns, Anna E.; Watson, David M.] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Burns, Anna E.; Watson, David M.] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Taylor, Gary S.] Univ Adelaide, Australian Ctr Evolutionary Biol & Biodivers, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Cunningham, Saul A.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Black Mt, ACT 2601, Australia",Charles Sturt University; Charles Sturt University; University of Adelaide; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Burns, AE (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Environm Sci, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia.",aeburns78@gmail.com,"Cunningham, Saul A/B-9947-2009","Cunningham, Saul A/0000-0003-0703-6893; David, Watson/0000-0003-1821-4632",Australian Post-graduate Award; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Ecological Society of Australia; Charles Sturt University,Australian Post-graduate Award(Australian Government); Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Ecological Society of Australia; Charles Sturt University,"This research was conducted while A.E.B was the recipient of an Australian Post-graduate Award.

Previous studies have suggested that host genera with high nitrogen are parasitized by more mistletoe species but these studies failed to take into account phylogenetic relationships among host genera. Our main question was whether more mistletoe species parasitize host genera with high nitrogen content when phylogenetic relationships were controlled. We also asked whether patterns in mistletoe parasitism were related to host geographic range size, host fruit type and host spinescence. Overall, we found no difference between conventional and phylogenetically controlled analyses. We also found no evidence for higher mistletoe species richness on host genera with high nitrogen, fleshy fruits or spinescence. However, similar to findings for animal parasites, we found that host genera with large geographic range had higher mistletoe species richness. This is likely because a greater number of mistletoe species will encounter hosts that have a greater geographic distribution. Mistletoe studies frequently assume that nitrogen status drives patterns in mistletoe parasitism but our study suggests that macroecological patterns in mistletoe assemblages are primarily determined by host geographic range.","[Griffiths, Megan E.; Ward, David] Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 256 Cunningham Hall, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Ruiz, Natalia] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Biol, Av Carrera 30 45-03 Cod Postal 111321, Bogota, Colombia",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Griffiths, ME (corresponding author), Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 256 Cunningham Hall, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",megan.griffiths@gmail.com,,,Claude Leon Foundation; National Research Foundation of South Africa,Claude Leon Foundation; National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"We thank Barry Lovegrove for advice on phylogenetic analyses, Ted Garland for providing phylogenetic analysis programs and Vanessa Stuart for laboratory assistance.

Understanding why parasitic plants do not always parasitize potentially suitable hosts requires a better understanding of the constraints that limit host use by parasitic plants. In Texas salt marshes, the parasitic plant Cuscuta indecora rarely parasitizes three hosts that support vigorous growth in the greenhouse. We identified three constraints on host use by C. indecora. First, a mismatch between the phenology of C. indecora and some suitable hosts meant that these hosts were not abundant when C. indecora was growing most vigorously, and therefore were underutilized. Second, C. indecora preferentially parasitized tall plants versus short ones, causing relatively short species to be underutilized. Third, C. indecora overwinters in some perennial hosts but has to reinfect annual hosts each year, causing annuals and perennials that do not support overwintering to be underutilized. In combination, these constraints, which reflect the general lack of mobility of parasitic plants relative to herbivores, remove half of the potential host species from the actual diet of C. indecora, and therefore likely represent a major limitation on the success of this parasite. Similar constraints are likely to limit the realized host range of many parasitic plants and select for generalized diet preferences.","[Marquardt, Emily S.; Pennings, Steven C.] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Pennings, SC (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",spennings@uh.edu,"Pennings, Steven C/A-8326-2013","Pennings, Steven C/0000-0003-4757-7125",University of Houston Coastal Center,University of Houston Coastal Center,"We thank the University of Houston Coastal Center for funding.

The seeds of these parasites can only germinate in the presence of a chemical compound that is exuded from the roots of their host. These compounds are called germination stimulants and so far several of these compounds have been identified in the exudates of hosts (and false hosts) of several Orobanche and Striga species. The germination stimulants play an important role in fine-tuning of the lifecycle of the parasites to that of their hosts. In this chapter we describe the processes that play a role in this interaction, for example how the germination stimulants are produced by the host and how they arc perceived by the parasite. Also we discuss the possible importance of the germination stimulants in determining host specificity.","[Bouwmeester, Harro J.] Plant Res Int, POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",,"Bouwmeester, HJ (corresponding author), Plant Res Int, POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",harro.bouwmeester@wur.nl,"Bouwmeester, Harro J/C-1414-2008; Matusova, Radoslava/A-1886-2017","Matusova, Radoslava/0000-0001-9181-295X","European Commission [the FP5 EU project Improved Striga Control in Maize and Sorghum [INCO-DEV, ICA4-CT-2000-30012]; FP6 EU Project Grain Legumes [FOOD-CT-2004-506223]; Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality in the form of an IAC fellowship; North-South programme; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) (NATO visiting-scientist fellowships to RM); Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD","European Commission [the FP5 EU project Improved Striga Control in Maize and Sorghum; FP6 EU Project Grain Legumes; Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality in the form of an IAC fellowship; North-South programme; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) (NATO visiting-scientist fellowships to RM); Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD","We thank Vicky Child for maize and S. hermonthica seeds as well as many helpful suggestions, the Maize Genetic COOP Stock Center for supplying seeds of maize mutants, Piet Arts of J.C.

Mistletoes have been studied in temperate countries regularly because they can be pests of cultivated plants and forest plantations. In comparison with temperate habitats, little is known about the ecology of mistletoes in the Neotropics. More emphasis should be given to neotropical mistletoes because they could be important elements of plant communities, acting as key resources for pollinators, seed dispersers and herbivores. Using a combination of findings from early mistletoe studies and empirical evidence from several recent case studies, we report emerging patterns of mistletoe interactions with associated organisms and propose aims for further studies. There has been increasing interest in working with mistletoes in Brazil. Although there are some data on the ecology of mistletoe seed dispersal, reproductive biology studies are scarce and represent a wide range of fieldwork to be explored. Knowledge of the basic biology of mistletoes will be very important for modeling their spatial distribution using metapopulation or epidemiological approaches. In this review, we summarize the studies conducted in the neotropical region in order to provide a framework for current research and new ideas for future investigations of mistletoes, especially in Brazil.","[Arruda, Rafael; Carvalho, Lucelia Nobre] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Inst Ciencias Nat Humanas & Sociais, Sinop, MT, Brazil; [Fadini, Rodrigo Ferreira] Univ Fed Oeste Para, Inst Biodiversidade & Florestas, Santarem, PA, Brazil; [Del-Claro, Kleber] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Inst Biol, BR-38400 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [Mourao, Fabiana Alves; Jacobi, Claudia Maria] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Geral, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Teodoro, Grazielle Sales] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Bot, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [van den Berg, Eduardo] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Biol, Setor Ecol, Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Caires, Claudenir Simoes] Univ Brasilia, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Bot, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Dettke, Greta Aline] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Dept Bot, Lab Fitoecol & Fitogeog, BR-90049 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso; Universidade Federal do Oeste do Para; Universidade Federal de Uberlandia; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Arruda, R (corresponding author), Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Inst Ciencias Nat Humanas & Sociais, Sinop, MT, Brazil.",rafael.arruda@pq.cnpq.br,"Arruda, Rafael/D-4362-2012; Teodoro, Grazielle S/K-2586-2014; Del-Claro, Kleber/N-3700-2019; Fadini, Rodrigo/C-7574-2013; Jacobi, Claudia M/B-7510-2013; Nobre Carvalho, Lucélia/D-5986-2013; van den Berg, eduardo/L-9617-2014; Del-Claro, K/C-5570-2013","Arruda, Rafael/0000-0003-2869-5134; Teodoro, Grazielle S/0000-0002-5528-8828; Fadini, Rodrigo/0000-0002-6873-1438; Nobre Carvalho, Lucélia/0000-0002-0673-0165; van den Berg, eduardo/0000-0002-0843-6437; Del-Claro, K/0000-0001-8886-9568; Caires, Claudenir/0000-0002-2012-5164","Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; Universidade Federal de Uberlandia; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Brazilian Research Council CAPES; CNPq [471695/2010-6, 479130/2006]; FAPEMAT [40810/2009]",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; Universidade Federal de Uberlandia; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Brazilian Research Council CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPEMAT(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Mato Grosso (FAPEMAT)),"We would like thank the many people who helped us in our extensive fieldwork at several field sites in Brazil, especially R.

The centre of the morphological variability and geographical distribution of the group lies on the north-eastern edge of the Alps in the Vienna Forest, while marginal, morphologically uniform populations occur in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Genetic variation and population structure within the distribution range of the group remains unknown; we hypothesise that the marginal population are genetically depauperate. Allozymes were used to assess the genetic structure of 27 populations present throughout the distribution area; four Melampyrum nemorosum populations from the Vienna Forest were also analysed because of the presumed hybridization. An artificial pollination experiment was carried out to examine the possibility of autogamy. Four enzyme systems were clearly resolved and scored for one polymorphic locus each with a total of 20 alleles. Seven out of 49 flowers with preserved stamens developed seeds after self-pollination. Genetic variation was generally congruent with the known pattern of the morphological variation of the group. The allelic richness was higher in the Austrian populations than in marginal Czech and Slovak populations. Some wide-leaved populations from the Vienna Forest had a rather high.number of alleles which may be caused by allelic enrichment due to former hybridization with M. nemorosum. Czech and Slovak populations are genetically derived from Austrian populations. The high differentiation among populations suggests that the current gene flow between populations is limited. The high inbreeding coefficient in some populations indicates that there is a certain level of selfing within the populations. The pollination experiment does not contradict the possibility of autogamy. In general, our data are congruent with the central-marginal model with more variable Austrian populations and less variable isolated and probably partly inbreeding Czech and Slovak populations.

It is still poorly understood how different host plants in communities contribute to parasite performance, as species that are good hosts in single-host experiments may not necessarily be preferred hosts in mixtures. We grew the root hemiparasite Rhinanthus alectorolophus (Orobanchaceae) together with each of 13 host species (experiment 1) and with 15 different four-species mixtures of these hosts (experiment 2) that differed in the number of legumes and of host functional groups. Parasites profited from mixtures including more legumes and from mixtures including different host functional groups. Some host species and mixtures were very tolerant of parasitism and supported large parasites without being strongly suppressed in their own growth, but the suppression of a species in the single-host experiment did not explain the suppression of a species in a host mixture. We thus calculated for each host species an index of the difference in suppression between the two experiments which may be related to host use in a mixture. Host quality (mean parasite biomass with a host species) in the single-host experiment could explain 64% of the variation in parasite biomass with a host mixture when it was weighted by the proportion of the host species in the mixture without the parasite and by the suppression difference index. Our results suggest that plant species which are the best hosts in single-host experiments are not always those used most strongly by a parasite growing with a mixture. Together with the finding that hemiparasites benefit from a mixed diet based on hosts from different functional groups this suggests that parasites prefer certain host species to obtain a mixed diet.","[Sandner, Tobias Michael; Matthies, Diethart] Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Ecol, Fac Biol, DE-35043 Marburg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg,"Sandner, TM (corresponding author), Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Ecol, Fac Biol, DE-35043 Marburg, Germany.",tobias.sandner@biologie.uni-marburg.de,,"Matthies, Diethart/0000-0003-2439-0501",,,,,57,11,11,4,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,2018,127,9,,,,,1291,1303,,10.1111/oik.05148,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.05148,,,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GS1QG,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000443304900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Parasitized species ranged from wild shrubs to fruit and forest trees. Eleven Fabaceae species were parasitized by acacia strap flower, whereas Oriental mistletoe parasitized six Rosaceae species. Caper, pomegranate, white weeping broom, and white willow were attacked by both parasites. Infection by both parasites resulted in mortality of host plants in many cases. Hosts severely attacked by acacia strap flower were African jujube, Australian pine, chinaberry, Christ thorn jujube, common jujube, oleander, poinciana, sumac, tamarisk, terebinth, and white weeping broom. Oriental mistletoe heavily parasitized almond, mosphilla, olive, Palestine buckthorn, pomegranate, and white weeping broom.

Caruel (Scrophulariaceae), were examined in habitats where introduced, mixed introduced plus native, or solely native species provided potential hosts. Presence of haustoria on host roots confirmed parasitism of 17 introduced and ten native taxa across the sites investigated. Paired plots, one with all hosts removed early in the season, the other left intact, showed overall increases in shoot dry matter of the parasites over 3 months of growth. Results indicated a substantial growth benefit to the parasite from continued access to introduced and indigenous plant species, although the parasite continued growing to a limited extent after removal of hosts. Carbon isotope discrimination values (delta(13)C) were consistently more negative for parasites than for associated hosts, and more negative for parasites in plots containing hosts than in plots from which hosts had been removed. Values for delta(15)N discrimination of shoot dry matter of parasites lay mostly within the range of those of hosts. The delta(13)C data suggested poorer water use efficiency of parasite than hosts, while corresponding delta(15)N data indicated particularly effective uptake of N-containing compounds from the N-2-fixing host, Lotus angustissimus. Where the parasite had access to only one or a few closely related hosts, the composition of the soluble amino fraction of its leaves generally matched that of foliage of host(s). However, in some instances the parasite accumulated certain amino compounds to a much greater or lesser relative extent than did its partner host(s). Where many hosts were being exploited, compositional features of the soluble amino fraction of the parasite suggested major access to nitrogenous solutes from specific hosts. Data are discussed in relation to previously published observations on haustorial-derived benefits indicated for other species of root hemiparasites.

Yet, parasitic plants are characteristically rare in undisturbed habitats, and patterns of distribution within host populations are often highly nonuniform. Previous work on root and shoot parasites has identified strict germination requirements for many species but, while explaining host ranges and site-microsite preferences for particular species, this cannot account for the highly clumped spatial structure of many parasitic plant populations. Other research has examined the role of seed vectors, but in most systems studied, dispersers are not limiting and their dietary breadth, substrate use, habitat preferences, and distributional ranges exceed the extent of the parasitic plant. Here, I propose the host-quality hypothesis, suggesting that variation in the quality of potential hosts can account for nonrandom occurrence patterns of parasitic plants in many systems. Quality can relate to access to water, nutrients, or other resources that are generally limiting to hosts, whereby parasites are more likely to establish and survive on hosts with greater access (i.e., higher quality from the parasite's perspective). Rather than supplanting germination requirements operating at the individual host plant scale or disperser behaviour operating at the landscape scale, this resource-based hypothesis applies at stand and population scales, explaining why some individuals within a stand or population are infected, while other apparently similar hosts are not susceptible. This hypothesis is explored using case studies on root and shoot hemiparasites. and is consistent with a diverse array of findings from a range of temperate and and systems.","Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"Watson, DM (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia.",dwatson@csu.edu.au,,"David, Watson/0000-0003-1821-4632",,,,,39,65,68,7,47,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",1916-2790,1916-2804,,BOTANY,Botany,JAN,2009,87,1,,,,,16,21,,10.1139/B08-105,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/B08-105,,,6,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Plant Sciences,397PC,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000262673600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The richness of African mistletoes from the Loranthaceae and Viscaceae, along with many aspects of their biology and ecology, was covered in the comprehensive monograph of Polhill and Wiens (1998, Mistletoes of Africa, Royal Botanic Gardens). The present review is devoted to the taxonomic and functional diversity of symbionts associated with mistletoes in Africa and adjacent islands that contribute to the major biological functions of mistletoes, such as establishment and growth, nutrition and fitness, resistance to external stresses, as well as pollination and dispersal. These functions are favored by more or less distinct sets of associated bionts, including host plants, animal herbivores, frugivorous birds, nectar- and pollen-feeding insects, and endophytic microorganisms. A separate section is devoted to mistletoe epiparasitism as a special case of host selection. All these organisms, which are components of the mistletoe-associated community and multitrophic network, define the role of mistletoes as keystone species. Some aspects of the symbiont communities are compared here with patterns reported for mistletoes from other continents, particularly to identify potential relationships that remain to be explored for the African species.

For this reason, in the present study, its infestation in the forest populations of Sierra Fria, Aguascalientes was examined in order to: a) understand the factors that influence the abundance of mistletoe; (b) determine the infestation level present in host species and (c) identify if there exists specific types of mistletoe that correspond to different species and sizes of the host and / or habitat. In January 2007, 20 sampling locations were selected within which two sampling units were established (UM) of 2500 m(2). In every UM the height and diameter of all individuals (infected and uninfected) > 1 m in height were measured and the presence of mistletoe was recorded. Also recorded was the altitude, incline, slope orientation, level of disturbance and degree of infestation. The results indicate that the level of mistletoe infection shows positive association with altitude and orientation and a negative association with disturbance. It was found that as the size of dasometric attributes (height, diameter) increases so too does the degree of infection. Phoradendron bolleanum was the most abundant species of mistletoe, with Juniperus deppeana being its most common host. In contrast to that reported by other works, Sierra Fria forest populations are not found to be severely affected by mistletoe. Nevertheless, it is recommended that future studies be undertaken that allow for the understanding of the factors that shape the distribution and hemiparasitic-host interaction within and between populations, in order to assess real or future damage and to evaluate the selectivity towards certain host species and chemical changes from which trees suffer as a result of infection.","[Clark-Tapia, Ricardo; Alfonso-Corrado, Cecilia; Gonzalez-Adame, Gabriel; Bretado-Velazquez, Jorge] Univ Sierra Juarez, Inst Estudios Ambientales, Ixtlan De Juarez 68725, Oaxaca, Mexico; [Torres-Bautista, Brenda] Univ Autonoma Aguascalientes, Herbarium, Aguascalientes 20100, Ags, Mexico; [Valdez-Hernandez, Juan I.] PF COLPOS, Texcoco 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Campos-Contreras, Jorge] UNAM, Unidad Biotecnol & Prototipos, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Tlalnepantla 54000, Estado De Mexic, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Aguascalientes; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Clark-Tapia, R (corresponding author), Univ Sierra Juarez, Inst Estudios Ambientales, Av Univ S-N, Ixtlan De Juarez 68725, Oaxaca, Mexico.",rclark@juppa.unsij.edu.mx,"Campos, Jorge/AAG-1040-2019; Campos, Jorge/AAI-2780-2020","Campos, Jorge/0000-0002-8263-2671; Clark-Tapia, Ricardo/0000-0002-0821-8106",,,,,32,4,6,0,22,INST ECOLOGIA A C,XALAPA,"KM 2 5 CARR ANT A COATEPEC NO 351, CONGREGACION EL HAYA, XALAPA, VER 00000, MEXICO",2448-7597,,,MADERA BOSQUES,Madera Bosques,SUM,2011,17,2,,,,,19,33,,,,,,15,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,962XA,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000305580900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Alpine grassland is an important and characteristic ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but ca. 30 % has been severely degraded by the combined effects of climate change, human activity, overgrazing and rodent damage. One potential method to restore grassland diversity involves using hemiparasitic plants to modify the competitive relationships among neighboring species. A possible candidate is Pedicularis kansuensis, a hemiparasitic plant found in grasslands throughout the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but more information on its host associations and its effects on surrounding vegetation is required to assess its suitability. Thus, we examined host associations of P. kansuensis by direct root excavation at a selected site on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and found that haustoria formation is non-randomly distributed among host species, with preferential bias for members of Poaceae, Rosaceae and Fabaceae. We also found that aboveground biomass of grasses and legumes was higher in quadrats from which the parasite had been removed than in intact controls, while the biomass of sedges and forbs was unaffected by parasite removal. However, removal significantly decreased plant species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity. These results suggest that P. kansuensis modifies the competitive balance in grassland communities of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, allowing for colonization by subordinate species and thereby enhancing species diversity and contributing to restoration of these degraded grasslands.","[Bao, Gensheng; Yao, Xiang; Liu, Li; Li, Chunjie] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730020, Peoples R China; [Bao, Gensheng; Wang, Hongsheng] Qinghai Acad Anim Sci & Vet Med, Grassland Inst, Xining 810003, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Suetsugu, Kenji] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Ou, Jing] Qinghai Univ, Dept Biol, Xining 810016, Qinghai, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Qinghai University; Kyoto University; Qinghai University,"Li, CJ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, POB 61, Lanzhou 730020, Peoples R China.",baogsh12@lzu.edu.cn; chunjie@lzu.edu.cn,"Li, Chunjie/G-4988-2012; Suetsugu, Kenji/S-8762-2018","Li, Chunjie/0000-0002-3287-2140; Suetsugu, Kenji/0000-0002-7943-4164",National Key Basic Research Program (973) of China [2014CB138702]; Natural Science Foundation of China [31372366]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University [IRT13019]; Special Fund for Agro-Scientific Research in the Public Interest [201203041],National Key Basic Research Program (973) of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University(Program for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT)); Special Fund for Agro-Scientific Research in the Public Interest,"We wish to thank Dr. Jakub Tesitel and an anonymous reviewer for their constructive comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

The number of host species varies largely between groups, from single species or genus to hundreds of species. Relative abundance of the host and evolutionary history are the main requisites for parasitic plants to develop specificity to abundant hosts. In the present study, we suggest a novel mechanism by which a hemiparasitic mistletoe can develop local specificity mediated by its host. First, we describe a novel interaction in which a woodboring beetle (Hypothenemus obscurus) preys on mistletoe seeds (Psittacanthus plagiophyllus) attached to tree branches. This beetle preys more frequently on seeds deposited on branches of non-host species than on branches of its unique local host species (53 percent on average vs. 26 percent respectively). We hypothesize that local host specificity for this mistletoe could be partly mediated by beetle-host incompatibility, since the host offers a predation-free space in which mistletoes have better chances to grow. Furthermore, that the exceptional gum exudates produced by this unique host species minimize beetle attacks on branches, thus reducing predation of mistletoe seeds. This novel tritrophic interaction opens an avenue for research on macroscopic host-specificity mechanisms that occur at the level of the host bark and that have been poorly studied by plant ecologists.","[Fadini, Rodrigo F.; Ghizoni, Leidielly P.] Univ Fed Oeste Para, Programa Posgrad Recursos Nat Amazonia, BR-68035110 Sale, Santarem, Brazil; [Fadini, Rodrigo F.; Mellado, Ana] Univ Granada, Grp Ecol Terr, E-18071 Granada, Spain",Universidade Federal do Oeste do Para; University of Granada,"Fadini, RF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Oeste Para, Programa Posgrad Recursos Nat Amazonia, Rua Vera Paz, BR-68035110 Sale, Santarem, Brazil.",rodrigo.fadini@ufopa.edu.br,"Fadini, Rodrigo/C-7574-2013","Fadini, Rodrigo/0000-0002-6873-1438","CAPES; MICINN; UFOPA; CNPq [471695/2010-6]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM) [Edital 016/2006, Proc. 1437/2007]","CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); MICINN(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); UFOPA; CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM))","We are grateful to David Watson and two anonymous reviewers who improved our manuscript substantially and to Carlos Flecthmann for his assistance in beetle identification.

Interactions between parasitic plants and hosts often parallel those between herbivores and plants: both types of consumers display host preferences, reduce host biomass and alter host allocation patterns, modify plant community structure and dynamics, and mediate interactions between host plants and other organisms. In other cases, basic differences in mobility, hormonal and elemental composition and resource capture between plants and animals lead to different effects: parasitic plants have broad host ranges, affect and are affected by host plant physiology because of similar hormonal pathways between parasite and host, do not alter nutrient cycling as extensively as do herbivores, and may simultaneously parasitize and compete with hosts. Many fundamental aspects of the ecology of parasitic plants remain poorly studied, and research to date has been dominated by laboratory studies and studies of crop pests, rather than by studies of natural communities.","Univ Georgia, Inst Marine, Sapelo Isl, GA 31327 USA; Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Pennings, SC (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",spennings@uh.edu,"Pennings, Steven C/A-8326-2013","Pennings, Steven C/0000-0003-4757-7125",,,,,167,129,139,3,122,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2002,131,4,,,,,479,489,,10.1007/s00442-002-0923-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-002-0923-7,,,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,562UU,28547541,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000176218000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The response patterns of maximum photosynthesis, maximum carboxylation rate of rubisco, electron transport rate for ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate regeneration and CO2 assimilation rate of D. curvata revealed that its photosynthesis was co-limited by both light and temperature and did not saturate at natural CO2 concentrations (380 ppm). The effects of CO2 elevation on D. curvata photosynthesis was long term due to the partial dependence of obligate hemiparasitic mistletoe on host-derived carbon. Stomatal conductance of D. curvata was moderately sensitive to CO2 elevation under the natural conditions that the measurements were made.

Here, we use species from a recent radiation of generalist hemiparasitic Euphrasia to investigate trait variation and trait plasticity. We tested whether Euphrasia species show reliable trait differences, investigated whether these differences correspond to life history trade-offs between growth and reproduction, and quantified plasticity in response to host species. Methods Common garden experiments were used to evaluate trait differences between 11 Euphrasia taxa grown on a common host, document phenotypic plasticity when a single Euphrasia species is grown on eight different hosts, and relate observations to trait differences recorded in the wild. Results Euphrasia exhibited variation in life history strategies; some individuals transitioned rapidly to flowering at the expense of early season growth, while others invested in vegetative growth and delayed flowering. Life history differences were present between some species, though many related taxa lacked clear trait differences. Species differences were further blurred by phenotypic plasticity-many traits were plastic and changed with host type or between environments. Conclusions Phenotypic plasticity in response to host and environment confounds species delimitation in Euphrasia. When grown in a common garden environment, some morphologically distinct taxa can be identified, though others represent morphologically similar shallow segregates. Trait differences present between some species and populations demonstrate the rapid evolution of distinct life history strategies in response to local ecological conditions.","[Brown, Max R.; Twyford, Alex D.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Charlotte Auerbach Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Frachon, Natacha; Twyford, Alex D.] Royal Bot Garden Edinburgh, 20A Inverleith Row, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wong, Edgar L.

Psittacanthus calyculatus (Loranthaceae) is a hemiparasitic plant with a broad host range across its geographic distribution. The potential for local host adaptation has been shown using cross-inoculation experiments, in which plants of mistletoe seeds collected from a given host are more likely to survive when they are inoculated on conspecific host trees compared with those inoculated on other host provenances. Here we evaluate host adaptation by describing the local patterns of infection (prevalence and intensity) of P. calyculatus mistletoes on three native host tree species (Alnus acuminata, Quercus crassipes, Salix bonplandiana) and one introduced species (Populus alba) and carried out cross-pollination experiments to examine how pollination affects infection patterns of different host species. Mistletoe infection prevalence (proportion of infection) and infection intensity (mean number of mistletoes per tree) were in general disproportional with respect to the availability of native host tree species but higher to that of non-native host tree species. Cross-pollination experiments showed higher mating success on the native host tree species, suggesting higher local adaptation to specially Q. crassipes. The observed spatial distribution of host tree species and mistletoe infection along with the non-random mating could contribute to local genetic structuring of mistletoe populations.","[Jose Perez-Crespo, Maria; Francisco Ornelas, Juan] Inst Ecol AC INECOL, Dept Biol Evolut, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; [Jose Perez-Crespo, Maria; Lara, Carlos] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, Ctr Invest Ciencias Biol, San Felipe Ixtacuixtla 90120, Tlaxcala, Mexico",Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico,"Ornelas, JF (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC INECOL, Dept Biol Evolut, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico.",francisco.ornelas@inecol.mx,"Ornelas, Juan Francisco/A-2250-2014; PEREZ, MIRIAM/E-1260-2015","Ornelas, Juan Francisco/0000-0002-1124-1163; Lara, Carlos/0000-0001-6037-0327","Departamento de Biologia Evolutiva, Instituto de Ecologia, A.C.

How these parasite-host interactions impact on the fitness of hemiparasitic plants remain largely unknown. We used experimentally tractable eyebrights (Euphrasia, Orobanchaceae) to understand parasite-host species interactions affecting the performance of a generalist hemiparasitic plant. Common garden experiments were carried out measuring Euphrasia performance across 45 diverse hosts and in different parasite-host combinations. We show that variation in hemiparasite performance can be attributed mainly to host species and host phylogenetic relationships (lambda = 0.82; 0.17-1.00 CI). When variation in performance is considered temporally, annual host species cause earlier flowering, and lead to poorer performance late in the season. While Euphrasia species typically perform similarly on a given host species, some eyebrights show more specialized parasite-host species interactions. Our results show that generalist hemiparasites only benefit from attaching to a limited, but phylogenetically divergent, subset of hosts. The conserved responses of divergent Euphrasia species suggest hemiparasite performance is affected by common host attributes. However, evidence for more complex parasite-host species interactions show that a generalist hemiparasite can potentially respond to individual host selection pressures and may adapt to local host communities.","[Brown, Max R.; Twyford, Alex D.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Charlotte Auerbach Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Moore, Paloma G.

Morphological characteristics of haustoria are described and their anatomical features art: discussed in relation to uptake, transfer. and metabolism of xylem-borne nitrogenous solutes derived from a host. Experimental approaches used include comparisons of xylem sap composition of parasite and host(s), solute pool analyses and enzymatic properties of haustoria, host xylem feeding of N-15-labelled solutes to follow the fate of label in haustoria and body of the parasite, and studies using species-specific nonprotein amino acids to validate successful uptake from hosts or occasional backflow of xylem-borne solutes to a host. Field studies on promiscuous root hemiparasites assess frequencies of exploitation of different hosts. N-15 natural abundance assays of host and parasite dry matter demonstrate marked preference by Santalum acuminatum for N-2-fixing as opposed to nonfixing hosts. The ability of Olax phyllanthi to continue to exploit deep-rooted hosts ranks of importance when xylem water potentials of other hosts go our of sucking range during periods of water stress. Comparisons of xylem sap composition of parasites feeding on different hosts indicate remarkable versatility by haustoria in uptake and utilization of the different major nitrogenous solutes received from these hosts. Solute pools in parasites partly reflect metabolic transformations accentuated by haustoria while also indicating direct throughput from xylem of a host. The review concludes by showing how empirically based modelling techniques can be used to estimate proportional gains of N by parasites from single hosts and repercussions on host growth which accompany such exploitation.","Univ Western Australia, Dept Bot, Nedlands, WA 6907, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Pate, JS (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Dept Bot, Nedlands, WA 6907, Australia.",,"Pate, John S/K-2154-2012",,,,,,25,34,36,0,22,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0033-183X,1615-6102,,PROTOPLASMA,Protoplasma,,2001,215,1-4,,,,,204,217,,10.1007/BF01280315,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01280315,,,14,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,424FM,11732059,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000168221700018,View Full Record in Web of Science

I examined seasonal changes in the two freezing resistance mechanisms in leaves of alpine plants from two temperate mountain regions, Niwot Ridge (3500 m) in the Front Range of the Rocky Mts. (USA) and Modr, sedlo (1510 m) in the Giant Mts. (Czech Republic). Although plants from Niwot Ridge were on average ca. 2.6 K more resistant to freezing than plants from the Giant Mts., patterns of freezing resistance changes during the growing season were consistent between the two regions. Both freezing resistance mechanisms, i.e., avoidance by supercooling and tolerance of extracellular ice were encountered. Plants predominantly avoided freezing injury during early summer and tolerated extracellular freezing at the end of the growing season, and the seasonal change from avoidance to tolerance mechanisms was significant for both regions. The avoidance and tolerance mechanisms provided comparable freezing resistance to the plants during early summer but, unlike in avoidant plants, in tolerant plants resistance increased over the course of the season. The species formed three groups with regard to resistance mechanisms employed during the season: (1) species that avoided injury by supercooling during early summer and employed freezing tolerance towards autumn; (2) species that were freezing tolerant during the entire growing season; and (3) species with ephemeral shoots that solely avoided freezing by supercooling. Although freezing tolerance is a common feature in north-temperate alpine plants, avoidance by supercooling as a freezing resistance strategy might be selected for in species with particular life histories such as ephemeral hemiparasites.","[Sklenar, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, Prague 12801, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Sklenar, P (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, Prague 12801, Czech Republic.",petr.sklenar@natur.cuni.cz,"Sklenar, Petr/I-6527-2016","Sklenar, Petr/0000-0003-0429-2621",Fulbright visiting scholar fellowship,Fulbright visiting scholar fellowship,The research in the USA was supported by a Fulbright visiting scholar fellowship.

For example, parasitic plants obtain defensive compounds as well as nutrients from their hosts, and thus many attributes of parasitic plants are dependent on the quality of their host species. Here I measure the effect of a lupine host species (Lupinus argenteus) compared to other host species on herbivory, pollination, and female plant fitness in the hemiparasite Indian paintbrush (Castilleja miniata) using a series of field experiments. Association with lupine was determined in the field by assaying Indian paintbrush leaves for lupine alkaloids. I found that Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines experienced reduced herbivory from plume moth larvae, agromyzid fly larvae, and deer, relative to Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing other host species. However, there was no correlation between alkaloid content of inflorescences and plume moth performance. Host species did not affect pollinator preference for Indian paintbrush in the field. Indian paintbrush parasitizing lupines produced twice as many seeds overall as Indian paintbrush parasitizing other host species. Correlations suggest that this benefit arises both from reduced herbivory and increased nitrogenous resources. The reduction of herbivory in Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines indicates that host species can affect performance of hemiparasites via indirect pathways, and that the larger community of herbivores could alter the impact of a host on its plant parasites.","Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Adler, LS (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Biol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,,,,,,,67,29,31,3,54,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2002,83,10,,,,,2700,2710,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[2700:HEOHAP]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[2700:HEOHAP]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,617ER,,Green Submitted,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000179348800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We present results of preliminary studies on its habitat, demography, hemiparasitism, flower development, and pollination. While showing a strong preference for Abies spectabilis trunks and branches as a substrate, P. dendrothauma also grows on other species of trees and shrubs in the understorey as well as on dead wood on the forest floor, and only very rarely is rooted in soil or on rocks, rooted in a bryophyte layer. Demographic monitoring of the population in 1999 and 2001 allows us to begin to predict longevity, average size of flowering plants, and survivorship and flowering probability on different substrates. We demonstrate that individual plants of P. dendrothauma live at least four, and probably at least five years. Studies of haustoria show that the species has retained its hemiparasitic habit despite having moved from a terrestrial to an arboreal habitat. Flowering probability increases with plant size; an average flowering plant has five leaves and a longest leaf that measures 21.5 cm. Survivorship varies from substrate to substrate, with the greatest survivorship over a two year period occurring in plants growing on living trees. Flowering probability was the same for plants growing on living trees as it was for plants on dead wood. Studies of flower development suggest that plants growing high in the canopy proceeded through the stages of floral development more rapidly than plants nearer ground level. Despite many hours of field observation, the method of pollination remains a mystery; we suggest different possible pollination mechanisms.","Analyt Resources LLC, Bakersfield, VT 05441 USA; Univ S Bohemia, Dept Bot, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; Royal Bot Gardens, Edinburgh EH3 5LR, Midlothian, Scotland","University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew","Allard, DJ (corresponding author), Analyt Resources LLC, 1331 Waterville Mtn Rd, Bakersfield, VT 05441 USA.",dallard@aol.com; Martina.Petru@bf.jcu.cz; r.mill@rbge.org.uk,,,,,,,29,4,4,0,6,ACAD SCI CZECH REPUBLIC INST BOTANY,PRAGUE,"PRUHONICE NEAR PRAHA, PRAGUE 252 43, CZECH REPUBLIC",0015-5551,,,FOLIA GEOBOT,Folia Geobot.,,2005,40,2-3,,,,,135,149,,10.1007/BF02803230,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02803230,,,15,Plant Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,945YZ,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000230540200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

These traits have important impacts on host plants and non-host plants, and influence interactions with other trophic levels. Ultimately, they can affect community structure and functioning. Here, we review these physiological traits and discuss their ecological consequences. 2 The root hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae form a convenient subset of the parasitic angiosperms for study because: they are the most numerous and most widely distributed group of parasitic angiosperms; their physiological characteristics have been well studied; they are important in both agricultural and (semi)natural communities; and they are tractable as experimental organisms. 3 Key traits include: high transpiration rates; competition with the host for nutrients and haustorial metabolism of host-derived solutes; uptake of host-derived secondary metabolites; dual autotrophic and heterotrophic carbon nutrition; distinct carbohydrate biochemistry; high nutrient concentrations in green leaf tissue and leaf litter; and small (often hairless and non-mycorrhizal) roots. 4 Impacts on the host are detrimental, which can alter competitive balances between hosts and non-hosts and thus result in community change. Further impacts may result from effects on the abiotic environment, including soil water status, nutrient cycling and leaf/canopy temperatures. 5 However, for non-host species and for organisms that interact with these (e.g. herbivores and pollinators) or for those that benefit from changes in the abiotic environment, the parasites may have an overall positive effect, suggesting that at the community level, hemiparasites may also be considered as mutualists. 6 It is clear that through their distinctive suite of physiological traits hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae, have considerable impacts on community structure and function, can have both competitive and positive interactions with other plants, and can impact on other trophic levels. Many community level effects of parasitic plants can be considered analogous to those of other parasites, predators or herbivores.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",N8 Research Partnership; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; White Rose University Consortium; University of Sheffield,"Press, MC (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",m.c.press@sheffield.ac.uk,"Press, Malcolm Colin/ABB-3995-2021","Phoenix, Gareth/0000-0002-0911-8107",,,,,102,68,78,2,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

(Orobanchaceae) has been underinvestigated despite its wide distribution and potential ecological significance. To better understand the parasitic aspects of the root hemiparasites, host-parasite interactions were investigated with two sympatric Pedicularis species, Pedicularis rex C. B. Clarke and Pedicularis tricolor Hand.-Mazz., at two developmental stages. Plant DW, shoot phosphorus (P) content, root : shoot ratio and number of haustoria were measured in Pedicularis grown with either a host plant or a plant of its own species in pot experiments. In addition, effects of parasitism and intraspecific competition on growth and biomass allocation in four host species belonging to three major functional groups (grasses, legumes and forbs) were investigated. The two Pedicularis species showed obvious host preference, but preferred different host species. Interactions between Pedicularis and their hosts depended on both species identity and developmental stages of the partners. Overall, P. rex showed much weaker host dependency and less damage to hosts than P. tricolor. Interspecific variations were observed among different host species in their responses to intraspecific competition and parasitism. We concluded that different Pedicularis-host pairs showed different interaction patterns. Sympatric Pedicularis may have differential influence on plant community structure and productivity.","[Li, Ai-Rong; Guan, Kai-Yun] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Econ Plants & Biotechnol, Kunming 650204, Peoples R China; [Li, Ai-Rong; Smith, F.

They frequently act as keystone species by affecting competitive relations in plant communities and altering mineral nutrient cycling. Understanding their ecology has been hindered by the difficulty to identify host associations of hemiparasitic plants growing in natural conditions. Direct examination of host associations is only possible at sites with specific soil types (e.g. sandy substrates) that allow host roots to be traced to the shoot to identify the host species. We investigated the possibility of using a DNA barcoding-based approach to identify host associations of root hemiparasites growing naturally. Host associations of Melampyrum nemorosum, Rhinanthus major and Rhinanthus minor were investigated. Their root systems were washed free of soil to reveal haustorial connections. Host-root fragments were subjected to DNA extraction and the plastid DNA trnL intron was sequenced. The functioning of haustoria was examined in semi-thin anatomical sections. The analysis of the DNA of host roots yielded a ca 60% success rate. The Rhinanthus species were confirmed to attack mostly grasses and legumes. By contrast, Melampyrum nemorosum attached mainly to plants of Rosaceae and Asteraceae. In addition, both conspecific and heterospecific connections between the hemiparasites were frequently observed. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of the DNA barcoding approach for identifying host associations of root hemiparasites at sites where tracing host roots to their shoot is not possible due to soil structure or high rooting density.","[Hola, Eva; Kockova, Jitka; Tesitel, Jakub] Univ South Bohemia, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Branisovska 1760, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Hola, E (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Branisovska 1760, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",eva.neurazy@gmail.com,"Tesitel, Jakub/B-2452-2009","Hola, Eva/0000-0002-5123-251X",Czech Science Foundation [14-26779P],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This study was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (project No. 14-26779P).

The use of resistant cultivars is the easiest and most effective method to control the parasite. Several cowpea cultivars exhibiting resistance have been identified during the last decades. However, most resistant cultivars show a differential response when grown in different countries across West Africa, suggesting that there are different races of S. gesnerioides. In this study, we investigated the genetic variability within and between 43 populations of five of the previously recognised races of the parasite present in West Africa. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were used on up to 10 individuals from each population. These markers showed almost no genetic variability within populations. The variability between the populations was also extremely low and did not allow discrimination of the five races. There was a certain geographical structure, but no 'racial' clustering could be seen. Even AFLP markers previously reported to be race-specific on another set of Striga populations proved unable to discriminate between races in this collection of populations. Possible causes of the low level of genetic variability include the hypothesis that this strain has only quite recently arisen. Such a low level of variability and the absence of specific markers for the virulence will have consequences on the evolution of the parasite and on the development of adequate control methods.","[Dube, M-P; Belzile, F.

Often, plants employ defense strategies in response to the initial damage that are highly specific and can affect interactions with subsequent antagonists. In addition to herbivores and pathogens, plants face attacks by parasitic plants, but we know little about how prior herbivory compared to prior parasite attachment affects subsequent host interactions. If host plants can respond adaptively to these different damage types, we predict that prior parasitism would have a greater deterrent effect on subsequent parasites than would prior herbivory. To test the effects of prior parasitism and prior herbivory on subsequent parasitic dodder (Cuscuta spp.) preference, we conducted two separate greenhouse studies with tomato hosts (Solanum lycopersicum). In the first experiment, we tested the effects of previous dodder attachment on subsequent dodder preference on tomato hosts using three treatments: control plants that had no previous dodder attachment; dodder-removed plants that had an initial dodder seedling attached, removed and left in the same pot to simulate parasite death; and dodder-continuous plants with an initial dodder seedling that remained attached. In the second experiment, we tested the effects of previous caterpillar damage (Spodoptera exigua) and mechanical damage on future dodder attachment on tomato hosts. Dodder attached most slowly to tomato hosts that had dodder plants previously attached and then removed, compared to control plants or plants with continuous dodder attachment. In contrast, herbivory did not affect subsequent dodder attachment rate. These results indicate that dodder preference depended on the identity and the outcome of the initial attack, suggesting that early-season interactions have the potential for profound impacts on subsequent community dynamics.","[Tjiurutue, Muvari Connie; Palmer-Young, Evan C.; Adler, Lynn S.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Morrill Sci Ctr South 221, 611 North Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Tjiurutue, Muvari Connie] Univ Namibia, Dept Chem & Biochem, Windhoek, Namibia",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Namibia,"Tjiurutue, MC (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Morrill Sci Ctr South 221, 611 North Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Tjiurutue, MC (corresponding author), Univ Namibia, Dept Chem & Biochem, Windhoek, Namibia.",connie.muv@gmail.com,"Palmer-Young, Evan/AFL-1225-2022","Palmer-Young, Evan/0000-0002-9258-2073",Fulbright Fellowship [15101429]; Schlumberger Faculty for the Future Fellowship; Plant Biology Graduate program; USDA NIFA predoctoral fellowship [2016-67011-24698]; USDA/CSREES (Hatch) [MAS000411]; USDA [NRI 2008-02346],Fulbright Fellowship; Schlumberger Faculty for the Future Fellowship(Schlumberger); Plant Biology Graduate program; USDA NIFA predoctoral fellowship; USDA/CSREES (Hatch)(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"This work is supported by: MCT: Fulbright Fellowship (15101429), Schlumberger Faculty for the Future Fellowship and the Plant Biology Graduate program; EPY: USDA NIFA predoctoral fellowship, Award number 2016-67011-24698; LSA: USDA/CSREES (Hatch) MAS000411 and USDA NRI 2008-02346.

They are represented by some 4000 species and can be found in most major biomes. They acquire some or all of their water, carbon and nutrients via the vascular tissue of the host's roots or shoots. Parasitism has major impacts on host growth, allometry and reproduction, which lead to changes in competitive balances between host and nonhost species and therefore affect community structure, vegetation zonation and population dynamics. Impacts on hosts may further affect herbivores, pollinators and seed vectors, and the behaviour and diversity of these is often closely linked to the presence and abundance of parasitic plants. Parasitic plants can therefore be considered as keystone species. Community impacts are mediated by the host range of the parasite ( the diversity of species that can potentially act as hosts) and by their preference and selection of particular host species. Parasitic plants can also alter the physical environment around them-including soil water and nutrients, atmospheric CO2 and temperature-and so may also be considered as ecosystem engineers. Such impacts can have further consequences in altering the resource supply to and behaviour of other organisms within parasitic plant communities.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",N8 Research Partnership; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; White Rose University Consortium; University of Sheffield,"Press, MC (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",m.c.press@sheffield.ac.uk,"Press, Malcolm Colin/ABB-3995-2021","Phoenix, Gareth/0000-0002-0911-8107",,,,,123,340,375,9,299,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0028-646X,1469-8137,,NEW PHYTOL,New Phytol.,JUN,2005,166,3,,,,,737,751,,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01358.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01358.x,,,15,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,921FX,15869638,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000228750700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Parasitism evolved 12 times independently in the evolution of angiosperms of which approximately 1% (4500 species) are parasitic. Not only are parasitic plants diverse in terms of evolutionary origins but also in terms of their physiological functioning and ecological behaviour. Methods - Here, I review the importance of principal functional traits which underlie the physiology and ecology of individual parasitic plants. These include the ability to perform photosynthesis, anatomical details of the vascular connection to the host determining the quality of resources acquired from the host, location of the haustoria on the host, which is closely connected with the parasite life form, and the mode of germination (either triggered by environmental condition or induced by presence of host roots). Results and conclusions - Based on the distribution of all these traits in parasitic plants, I introduce their functional classification into root hemiparasites, root holoparasites, stem parasites and endophytic parasites. In addition to the classification, I also present an evolutionary hypothesis explaining the evolution of advanced parasitic plant forms from root hemiparasites. This hypothesis is based on ecological constraints from which the parasites are released with increasing ability to acquire resources from the host. This evolutionary process also implies increasing host specificity which imposes new constraints on the ability to establish host connection. This explains the evolutionary stability of photosynthetic hemiparasites and their species richness which is one order of magnitude higher than that of holoparasites.","[Tesitel, Jakub] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Branisovska 1760, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Tesitel, J (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Branisovska 1760, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",jakub.tesitel@centrum.cz,"Tesitel, Jakub/B-2452-2009",,Czech Science Foundation [P505/12/1390],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by Czech Science Foundation (project no.

Psittacanthus robustus (Loranthaceae) is a neotropical hemiparasite that mainly colonizes species of the family Vochysiaceae. Vochysia thyrsoidea is the main host of P. robustus and is commonly found in areas of cerrado rupestre (rocky savanna), an abundant vegetation in our study site. We conducted the study in the ecological park Parque Ecologico Quedas do Rio Bonito (PEQRB), over an area of 2.82 ha of cerrado rupestre. The objective of this work was to investigate population structure, parasitic behavior (mistletoe grip height and circumference of host branch), and spatial distribution of Psittacanthus robustus on a population of Vochysia thyrsoidea. We sampled 267 V. thyrsoidea individuals and found that the population had a random distribution pattern. Seventy-nine individuals (29.6% of the sample population) hosted the hemiparasite, to a total of 193 P. robustus individuals. The number of mistletoe individuals per host plant ranged between 1 and 12. The V. thyrsoidea individuals most infested with mistletoes were those reaching greater heights. The correlation between height of host plant and preferred grip height was highly significant, with the preferred grip height being the uppermost portions of host plants. The crown size of P. robustus individuals ranged between 10 and 230 cm. The main disperser of P. robustus fruit was found to be swallow-tanager Tersina viridis viridis. Its activities led to a clumped pattern of spatial distribution of the hemiparasite along with higher infestation in larger trees. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

The interactions can be divided into aboveground and belowground interactions. Because both groups of plants are autotrophic, they compete for light aboveground. Belowground interactions are more complex. The host plants compete for resources in the soil and the hemiparasitic plants prey on the host plants through haustoria, using the hosts as the main source of water and nutrients. In this paper, we modeled the relationship between these two plant types, extending the well-known Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model to cover both light competition and intra-specific parasitism among hemiparasites. We included a realistic relationship of carrying capacity to environmental productivity and followed model behavior on a productivity gradient. The model shows that, at very low productivities, there are only a few poor hosts and hemiparasites have no chance to persist. As productivity increases, there is a range of productivity where both plant types coexist. A further increase in productivity gets the system out of the coexistence range, and only host plants survive. This final prediction successfully explains patterns observed in empirical data, contrary to the results of an earlier, oversimplified model of the explored interaction. Comparison of various models demonstrates that the model is able to reproduce the decline of hemiparasites with increasing productivity only when competition for light is included.","[Fibich, Pavel; Leps, Jan] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Branisovska 31, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Leps, Jan; Berec, Ludek] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Entomol, Ctr Biol, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Berec, Ludek] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Sci, Inst Math & Biomath, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech Academy of Sciences; Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Fibich, P (corresponding author), Univ S Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Branisovska 31, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",pavel.fibich@prf.jcu.cz,"Fibich, Pavel/B-3013-2015; Berec, Ludek/G-7253-2014; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013","Fibich, Pavel/0000-0001-9066-3753; Berec, Ludek/0000-0002-2419-3324; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429", [GACR 206/08/H044];  [GAAV IAA601410805];  [MSM6007665801];  [Z50070508];  [MSM6383917201],; ; ; ; ,"We are grateful for helpful discussions with Jakub Tesitel and Martina Petru.

We surveyed the hosts of the laurel dodder (Cassytha filiformis, Lauraceae) in China, representing 184 species from 146 genera, 67 families, and spanning flowering plants, conifers, and ferns, using host phylogenetic relationships to investigate the susceptibility to attack by this hemiparasitic plant among the vascular plants. The process of produced well-formed haustoria by C. filiformis was also observed in detail for six different hosts. Our results show that C. filiformis grows mainly on trees and shrubs from phylogenetically divergent members of the rosid and asterid eudicot clades, often attacking multiple adjacent hosts simultaneously, and forming extensive colonies. However, whether and to what extent transitions between C. filiformis and host plants occur remain unclear.

Parasitic plants are components of many habitats and have pronounced effects on animal diversity; shaping distributions, influencing movement patterns and boosting species richness. Many of these plants provide fleshy fruit, nectar, foliar arthropods and secure nest sites, but the relative influence of these nutritional and structural resources on faunal species richness and community structure remains unclear. 2. To disentangle these factors and quantify the resources provided by parasitic plants, we focused on the hemiparasitic shrub Exocarpos strictus (Santalaceae). Twenty-eight Eucalyptus camaldulensis forest plots were studied in the Gunbower-Koondrook forest in southeastern Australia, comparing riparian forests with an Exocarpos-dominated understorey with otherwise similar habitats with or without equivalent cover of the non-parasitic Acacia dealbata. Analyses of avian richness and incidence (overall and in six feeding guilds) were complemented by explicit measures of resources in both shrub types; foliage density, standing crop of fleshy fruit and foliar arthropod abundance and biomass. 3. Avian species richness was c. 50% greater and total incidences for five guilds were significantly greater in forests with the parasitic shrub, with no appreciable differences between the other two habitat types. In addition to plentiful fleshy fruits, Exocarpos supported abundant arthropods in their foliage - significantly higher in biomass than for equivalent volumes of Acacia foliage. Exocarpos had a shorter and denser structure, providing a greater range of microhabitats than the more open growing Acacia. 4. Our results demonstrate that structural and nutritional resources (both direct and indirect) provided by Exocarpos affect diversity and community composition, with each set of resources affecting different organismal groups. Rather than an exceptional system or an aberrant result, we suggest the influence of Exocarpos on species richness relates to their parasitic habit, supporting the hypothesis that parasitic plants mobilize resources from their hosts and make them available to a range of trophic levels.","[Watson, David M.; McGregor, Hugh W.; Spooner, Peter G.] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"Watson, DM (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia.",dwatson@csu.edu.au,"McGregor, Hugh W/T-2283-2017; Spooner, Peter/C-1321-2008","McGregor, Hugh W/0000-0003-3255-9282; Spooner, Peter/0000-0002-7704-172X; David, Watson/0000-0003-1821-4632",Winnifred Violett Scott Fund,Winnifred Violett Scott Fund,"We are indebted to Kylie Eklom, whose keen eyes and steady hands ensured accurate enumeration of arthropod samples.

In a pot study, we tested the effects of two non-N-2-fixing (Bischofia polycarpa (Levl.) Airy Shaw and Dracontomelon duperreranum Pierre) and two N-2-fixing hosts (Acacia confusa Merr. and Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen) on the growth characteristics and nitrogen (N) nutrition of S. album. Biomass production of shoot, root and haustoria, N and total amino acid were significantly greater in S. album grown with the two N-2-fixing hosts. Foliage and root delta N-15 values of S. album were significantly lower when grown with N-2-fixing than with non-N-2-fixing hosts. Significantly higher photosynthetic rates and ABA (abscisic acid) concentrations were seen in S. album grown with D. odorifera. Similarity in the proportional amounts of amino acid of root xylem sap between S. album and its host D. odorifera was also evident, suggesting major access to nitrogenous solutes from D. odorifera to S. album. Irrespective of host species, S. album clearly appeared to optimize xylem sap extraction from its hosts by higher transpiration and lower water-use efficiency than its host. The growth of two non-N-2-fixing hosts parasitized by S. album was significantly greater than the equivalent values for unparasitized treatments, and lower growth and photosynthesis were observed for parasitized A. confusa, and significant decreases in root N, photosynthesis and transpiration for parasitized D. odorifera compared with unparasitized treatments. Furthermore, foliage ABA concentrations were significantly higher in all hosts parasitized by S. album than in their unparasitized counterparts. Our study is probably the first to report on host dependence and preference in the hemiparasite S. album, and the generated results may have important implications for understanding of the physiological interactions between host species and parasitic plants, and for successfully mixing plantations of S. album with D. odorifera.","[Lu, J.

The parasite was unable to survive in plots where the weed was selectively removed by hoeing, but persisted and increased in the untreated control. Herbicides were more effective at killing Thesium than suppressing C. macrocephalum. A host-specific rust attacking the foliage of C. macrocephalum had no impact on T. utile survival. Weed control measures against C. macrocephalum are not likely to threaten native Thesium species as they have a large range of host species.

We analysed the relative fitness of both species by following their fate from germination to seed production in three different hydric treatments (wet, moist and dry) in a garden experiment. We found that R. angustifolius was either as fit as or fitter than R. minor in all conditions and for all studied parameters, with a slightly higher flower production in R. angustifolius in the wet treatment. Wet conditions had a negative effect on germination and flowering rate, but they increased flower and seed production.

We studied the effects of the Pacific mistletoe, Phoradendron villosum, a member of a largely autotrophic genus, on three species of deciduous California oaks. We found no effects of mistletoe presence on radial growth or survivorship and detected a significant positive relationship between mistletoe and acorn production. This latter result is potentially explained by the tendency of P. villosum to be present on larger trees growing in nitrogen-rich soils or, alternatively, by a preference for healthy, acorn-producing trees by birds that potentially disperse mistletoe. Our results indicate that the negative consequences of Phoradendron presence on their hosts are negligible-this species resembles an epiphyte more than a parasite-and outweighed by the important ecosystem services mistletoe provides.","[Koenig, Walter D.; Pesendorfer, Mario B.; Dickinson, Janis L.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Koenig, Walter D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Knops, Johannes M.

Struthanthus dichotrianthus turned out to be an effectively generalist species, despite showing a very low resource index, that is, it concentrated its interaction capacity on few woody species.","[Vera, Antonio; Maldonado, Rafael; Socorro, Yajaira] Ctr Invest Biol, Lab Ecol, Madrid, Spain; [Martinez, Maritza] Univ Zulia, Ctr Invest Quim Prod Nat Dra Gladys Leon de Pinto, Fac Humanidades & Educ, Maracaibo, Venezuela",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CIB),"Vera, A (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Biol, Lab Ecol, Madrid, Spain.",ajvera68@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZULIA, FACULTAD AGRONOMIA",MARACAIBO,"APARTADO 15205, MARACAIBO, ZU 4005, VENEZUELA",0378-7818,2477-9407,,REV FAC AGRON LUZ,Rev.

In mixed communities of hosts, hemiparasites prefer some hosts over others, but it is not yet known if hemiparasite roots can distinguish between the roots of different plant species and show directed growth (host tropism). We performed host choice experiments, exposing seedlings of Rhinanthus alectorolophus in agar plates simultaneously to seedlings of grass and legume species known to be hosts of good or poor quality for the parasite, and measured directed root growth and haustoria formation. Parasite roots did not show directed growth towards the roots of a good compared to a poor host species within a host functional group. However, parasite roots grew more strongly in the direction of legume than grass roots. The probability to form haustoria with host roots did not differ between host species, and microscopy revealed that functional haustoria were formed even with a very poor host, the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum. Our results show that growth experiments in agar plates are a suitable approach to study early host choice of hemiparasites. Our finding that hemiparasites can (initially) form functional haustoria even with very poor hosts emphasizes that the quality of a plant species as a host depends on several independent processes, including early host recognition, haustoria formation, resource supply and competition.","[Sandner, Tobias M.; Schoppan, Lola; Matthies, Diethart] Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, Plant Ecol, Karl von Frisch Str 8, D-35043 Marburg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg,"Sandner, TM (corresponding author), Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, Plant Ecol, Karl von Frisch Str 8, D-35043 Marburg, Germany.",tobias.sandner@biologie.uni-marburg.de,,,Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,52,1,1,11,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1211-9520,1874-9348,,FOLIA GEOBOT,Folia Geobot.,JUL,2022,57,2,,,,,117,126,,10.1007/s12224-022-09414-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12224-022-09414-1,,JUL 2022,10,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,4A3FN,,hybrid,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000828418400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) translocation from hosts to hemiparasites affect growth and development, but detailed C and N economies between hemiparasites and N-2-fixing hosts are unknown. In a 6-year-old Santalum album (sandalwood) plantation, concurrent movement of C and N between plants over 14 days were traced among N-2-fixing Acacia confusa, N-2-fixing Dalbergia odorifera (rosewood) and non-N-2-fixing hemi-parasitic sandalwood by adding C-13-labeled and N-15-labeled urea to leaves of one species (donor) and tracing the label into other two species (receivers) within three triple-tree combinations. Haustorial connections and host selectivity were also examined on roots and nodules within adjacent plants. N-2 fixation by acacia and rosewood was quantified in the stand by N-15 natural abundance. Parasitic haustoria of sandalwood on roots and nodules of N-2-fixing acacia and rosewood were more frequent than on other non-N-2-fixing herbaceous plants, indicating strong host selectivity and preference. N-2 fixation supplied 19.7% and 52.3% of the total N in acacia and rosewood, respectively. During 14 days of labeling, more C-13 and N-15 was transferred from acacia or rosewood to sandalwood than from sandalwood to these two N-2 fixers. Net C and N transfer between tree pairs indicated that hemiparasite sandalwood was the C sink or N sink when associated with N-2-fixing acacia or rosewood, while N-2-fixing acacia was the C sink or N sink when associated with N-2-fixing rosewood. This study indicated that mixed plantations had high rates of interplant nutrient transfer. Our results also showed that the herbaceous plants might acquire some C and N from sandalwood and two N-2-fixing plants via both direct and indirect transfers, suggesting a nutrient translocafion between plants within this community. This mixed plantation of acacia/rosewood/sandalwood could replace low-valued single species or mixed plantations for growing both high-value sandalwood and rosewood heartwoods. Our study quantified nutrient transfer among plants in a sandalwood plantation. These results have improved our understanding of the physiological interactions in resource acquisition between host species and parasitic plants and provided insights into promising mixed-plantation patterns for valuable tropical trees in south China and globally.","[Lu, J.

Fertilization of unattached B. trixago plants with inorganic nitrogen (ammonium nitrate) elicited neither the growth nor the photosynthetic responses observed in plants considered to be parasitic on legumes and in receipt of an enriched organic nitrogen supply. Both hemiparasites had high diurnal leaf conductances (g(s)) (469-2291 mmol m-2 s-1) and were at the upper end of the range of those measured in putative hosts (409-879 mmol m-2 s-1). In contrast with the latter, high nocturnal rates of g, were also recorded for the two hemiparasites (517-1862 mmol m-2 s-1).

Arctic plants may have evolved in situ or immigrated from the adjacent ecosystems. Frequently arctic species have disjunctive distributions between the Arctic and high mountain systems of the temperate zone. This pattern may result from long distance dispersal or from glacial plant migrations and extinctions of intermediate populations. The hemiparasitic genus Pedicularis is represented in the Arctic by c. 28 taxa and ranks among the six most species-rich vascular plant genera of this region. In this study, we test the hypothesis that these lineages evolved from predecessors occurring in northern temperate mountain ranges, many of which are current centers of diversity for the genus. We generated a nuclear ribosomal and chloroplast DNA phylogeny including almost all of the arctic taxa and nearly half of the genus as a whole. The arctic taxa of Pedicularis evolved 12-14 times independently and are mostly nested in lineages that otherwise occur in the high mountains of Eurasia and North America. It appears that only three arctic lineages arose from the present-day center of diversity of the genus, in the Hengduan Mountains and Himalayas. Two lineages are probably of lowland origin. Arctic taxa of Pedicularis show considerable niche conservatism with respect to soil moisture and grow predominantly in moist to wet soils. The studied characteristics of ecology, morphology, and chromosome numbers of arctic Pedicularis show a heterogeneous pattern of evolution. The directions of morphological changes among the arctic lineages show opposing trends. Arctic taxa are chiefly diploid, the few tetraploid chromosome numbers of the genus were recorded only for arctic taxa. Five arctic Pedicularis are annuals or biennials, life forms otherwise rare in the Arctic. Other genera of the Orobanchaceae consist also of an elevated number of short-lived species, thus hemiparasitism may favor this life form in the Arctic. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate the relative importance of plant traits in such interactions, we studied the role of the root hemiparasite, Castilleja levisecta (Orobanchaceae), as a mediator of interactions between the host plants it parasitizes and the lepidopteran herbivore Euphydryas editha (Nymphalidae), whose caterpillars feed on Castilleja and sequester iridoid glycosides from it. We tested whether the hemiparasite's size, leaf N concentration, and iridoid glycoside concentrations were influenced by the identity of its host plant, and then whether these traits influenced outcomes for the herbivore. We found that the hemiparasite's size and leaf N depended on the host it parasitized, and these traits in turn affected outcomes for E.editha. Specifically, Euphydryas editha survival increased with hemiparasite size and caterpillar mass increased with leaf N; caterpillars with greater mass were more likely to survive during diapause. We also found preliminary evidence that host identity influenced iridoid glycoside sequestration by the herbivore. Mean iridoid glycoside concentrations in caterpillars ranged from 1-12% depending on the host being parasitized by Castilleja. This study demonstrates that root parasitism can result in strong indirect effects on higher trophic levels, influencing organisms' survival, growth, and chemical interactions.","[Haan, Nathan L.; Bakker, Jonathan D.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 354115, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bowers, M.

This dual action suggests particular sensitivity of the parasite to climate change and any associated impacts on hosts and other members of the community. While little research has addressed the responses of parasitic plants to climate change in natural environments, impacts are predicted from controlled environment studies together with a knowledge of the key ecophysiological traits of hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae, in particular of Striga species, which are important weeds in semi-arid tropical agro-ecosystems, and Rhinanthus species, which can be important components of (principally) grassland communities in the northern temperate zone. The main mode of action of both elevated CO2 and warming will be through changes in photosynthesis and stomatal functioning. Enhanced photosynthesis of the hemiparasite and host will increase parasite carbon gains but may also increase the demand for host mineral nutrients. Mineral nutrition may, therefore, mediate the impacts of climate change on host-parasite associations. The relative insensitivity of hemiparasite stomata to elevated CO2 suggests that high stomatal conductances may be maintained and thus solute uptake may become limited by soil drying driven by higher rates of evapotranspiration and reduced precipitation. Climate change impacts on host-parasite interactions at the individual level will ultimately affect hemiparasite impacts at the community level. Community impacts will be greatest where climate change considerably favours hemiparasite populations or, conversely, causes them to disappear from communities where they were formerly abundant.

It has long been used for medicinal purposes in many countries and has increasingly influenced agricultural and natural ecosystems by its effects on a wide range of host species. Previous studies have focused on the taxonomy and evolutionary position of different Cassytha, with the pan-tropical species Cassytha filiformis being the most widely studied. However, Cassytha-host interactions have never been reviewed, which is an essential issue related to the understanding of mechanisms underlying plant hemiparasitic and the assessment of benefits and damage caused by aerial parasitic plants. This review explores the parasitic habits, worldwide distribution, and host range of Cassytha, and examines its impacts on the biology of host plants and the overall influence of environmental changes on Cassytha-host associations. We also comment on areas of future research directions that require to better understanding Cassytha-host interactions. It appeared that some traits, such as flowering phenology, facilitated Cassytha's widespread distribution and successful parasitism and that Cassytha preferred woody species rather than herbaceous species as a host, and preferred species from certain families as hosts, such as Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. Cassytha often decreased biomass and impacted the physiology of host species and global environmental changes seemed to intensify the negative impacts of Cassytha on their hosts. Cassytha was not only a noxious weed, but can also function as a biocontrol agent to mitigate alien plant invasion.","[Zhang, Hongxiang; Tennakoon, Kushan U.] Federat Univ, Inst Innovat Sci & Sustainabil, Future Reg Res Ctr, Ballarat, Vic, Australia; [Zhang, Hongxiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Florentine, Singarayer] Federat Univ, Inst Innovat Sci & Sustainabil, Future Reg Res Ctr, Ballarat, Vic, Australia","Federation University Australia; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Federation University Australia","Tennakoon, KU (corresponding author), Federat Univ, Inst Innovat Sci & Sustainabil, Future Reg Res Ctr, Ballarat, Vic, Australia.",k.tennakoon@federation.edu.au,,,,,,,135,2,2,3,15,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Seeds of the parasite were sown with those of a mixture of grassland plants as potential hosts. In most plants, seedling survival is strongly reduced by self-thinning at high densities, but in R. alectorolophus the proportion of seeds producing a young plant increased linearly with sowing density, indicating positive interactions among seedlings. Because survival to maturity was not influenced by density, the number of flowering plants per seed sown also increased with density. In contrast, mean plant size and reproduction were strongly reduced at high densities. It is suggested that resource sharing among parasites connected by haustoria is the most likely mechanism responsible for the reduced mortality of seedlings at high densities. The results indicate that facilitation among cohorts of conspecific root hemiparasites can increase the recruitment of young plants. The number of seeds produced per seed sown (a multiplicative fitness measure) was, however, independent of density in Rhinanthus because the early positive effects of density on recruitment were compensated later by the negative effects of crowding on growth and reproduction. Increased survival of seedlings could, however, indirectly increase fitness because it will increase the genetic diversity of offspring and may thus, for instance, reduce the impact of pathogens.","Univ Zurich, Inst Umweltwissensch, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Matthies, D (corresponding author), Univ Marburg, Fachbereich Biol, Karl von Frisch Str, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",,,"Matthies, Diethart/0000-0003-2439-0501",,,,,50,15,16,1,30,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",1435-8603,,,PLANT BIOLOGY,Plant Biol.,JAN,2003,5,1,,,,,79,84,,10.1055/s-2003-37978,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-2003-37978,,,6,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,666XZ,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000182202900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The hemiparasitic shrub Krameria lappacea (Dombey) Burdet and Simpson is here recorded as the first host plant known for S. flavaria, representing also the first record of the association of a species of Strymon Hubner with the plant family Krameriaceae. Females of S. flavaria lay eggs on flower buds and unripe fruits of K. lappacea; the larva eats mostly these plant organs. Field observations revealed that S. flavaria is a host-specialist hairstreak, since females lay eggs only on K. lappacea. These findings suggest that the altitudinal range of S. flavaria could be the result of its specialized association with K. lappacea, as this shrub is also mostly restricted to elevations above 3000 m in the Andes of northern Chile.

As hemiparasitic plant species, Hawaiian sandalwoods require a host plant for optimal forest establishment, yet the importance of a host during seedling development is unclear. Furthermore, understanding interactions between pot hosts and nutrient availability on sandalwood seedling development during nursery culture will help to promote the production of high-quality sandalwood seedlings for restoration and commercial purposes. We evaluated the effects of controlled-release fertilizer (CRF), chelated Fe treatments, and two pot host species (Acacia koa and Dodonaea viscosa) on the seedling development of Hawaiian sandalwood (Santalum paniculatum). Increased nutrient availability (CRF) led to increased dry mass, root collar diameter, shoot height, chlorophyll index, and nutrient status values, confirming that the hemiparasitic S. paniculatum can be successfully grown in early stages of cultivation by providing adequate mineral fertilizers. There was a significant interaction between the nutrient availability and chelated iron treatments associated with increased height, root collar diameter, dry mass, chlorophyll index, Fe concentration, and Fe content when chelated Fe was applied (vs. not) in a nutrient-limiting environment. The pot host treatment did not affect any growth metrics, but it did affect the total count of haustoria, with A. koa-hosted seedlings developing 60.3% more haustoria than D. viscosa-hosted and control seedlings. Our results demonstrate that high-quality S. paniculatum seedlings can be grown in containers by providing adequate nutrition and that S. paniculatum in a nutrient-limiting growing environment may benefit from chelated iron fertilizers.","[Speetjens, Tawn M.; Jacobs, Douglass F.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Jacobs, DF (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",djacobs@purdue.edu,,,,,,,84,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,MAR,2023,14,3,,,,,,,458,10.3390/f14030458,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f14030458,,,14,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,A6QU9,,gold,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000956356600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A better understanding of its life-cycle can help developing more effective management strategies. Here, we studied density dependence in S. hermonthica on Sorghum bicolor. We exposed two genotypes of S. bicolor that differed in the level of tolerance and resistance to S. hermonthica to a range of seed densities of the parasite. We evaluated multiple host and parasite performance parameters through periodic, destructive harvests and related these to the initial seed density using model selection. Initially, the probability for attachment was positively density-dependent, suggesting facilitation of new infections. However, at host maturity, S. hermonthica infection probability showed strong negative density dependence, indicating severe competition, in particular in the early developmental stages. Although parasite shoot dry weight showed a strong negative density dependence at host maturity, flower production per parasite exhibited positive density dependence again, suggesting compensation. The two host genotypes had similar responses to increased parasite densities, indicating differences between the genotypes in tolerance but not resistance. Consequently, despite density dependence in life-cycle components, the per capita reproductive output of S. hermonthica, R-0 (flowersseed(-1)) was density-independent. Apparently, management of the hemiparasite can neither benefit from a negatively density-dependent bottleneck, nor from a positively density-dependent Allee effect. The most promising suggestion to obtain S. hermonthica population decline (R-0<1) and long-term control is to increase host shading by growing a vigorous, competitive crop.","[Westerman, P.

Each holt transported a characteristic set of organic nitrogenous Solutes, but little or no nitrate, and the data indicated only limited direct flow of amino compounds between xylem streams of hosts and parasite. Proline predominated in the haustorium and xylem of Santalum, but was at negligible levels in the xylem of most hosts. Sucrose, fructose, glucose, malate and citrate were at high levels in all saps, and fructose especially prominent in Santalum. Chloride, sulphate and phosphate were the principal inorganic anions of the xylem. Based on C:N ratios of xylem and dry matter of Santalum and assuming a 70 % or mere dependence on the host for N, it was estimated that Santalum would gain approximately one third of its C requirement for dry matter production heterotrophically from the xylem of its hosts. Infiltration of xy]em of haustoria-bearing root segments of a major ''nest (Acacia rostellifera) with a range of N-15 labelled substrates resulted in 40-80 % of the N-15 of endophytes of the attached haustoria being received as proline. Nitrate reductase activity was induced in haustoria following host xylem feeding of nitrate. The study concludes that haustoria of Santalum act as a major site of synthesis and export of proline and might therefore play an important role in osmotic adjustment of the parasite and its related acquisition of water from hosts.

In order to better understand the potential role of hemiparasites in these processes, a comparison of leaf and litter tissue quality, nitrogen (N) resorption, and decomposability with those of a wide range of other plant groups (involving a total of 72 species and including other groups with access to alternative nutrient sources, such as nitrogen fixers and carnivorous plants) was undertaken in several sub-arctic habitats. The foliar N concentration of hemiparasites generally exceeded that of co-occurring species. Further, hemiparasites (and N fixers) exhibited lower N resorption efficiencies than their counterparts with no major alternative N source. As a consequence, annual and perennial hemiparasite litter contained, on average, 3.1% and 1.9% N, respectively, compared with 0.77-1.1% for groups without a major alternative N source. Hemiparasite litter lost significantly more mass during decomposition than many, but not all, co-occurring species. These results were combined with those of a litter trapping experiment to assess the potential impact of hemiparasites on nutrient cycling. The common sub-arctic hemiparasite Bartsia alpina was estimated to increase the total annual N input from litter to the soil by similar to42% within 5 cm of its stems, and by similar to53% across a site with a Bartsia alpina stem density of 43 stems/m(2). Our results therefore provide clear evidence in favor of a novel mechanism by which hemiparasites (in parallel with N-fixing species) may influence ecosystems in which they occur. Through the production of nutrient rich, rapidly decomposing litter, they have the potential to greatly enhance the availability of nutrients within patches where they are abundant, with possible consequent effects on small-scale biodiversity.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Ctr Arct Ecol, Sheffield S10 5BR, S Yorkshire, England; Climate Impacts Res Ctr, Abisko Naturvetenskapliga Stn, SE-98107 Abisko, Sweden; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Syst Ecol, Inst Ecol Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Wales, Inst Biol Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DD, Dyfed, Wales; Urals State Univ, Dept Plant Physiol, Ekaterinburg 620083, Russia; Inst Bot, Physiol Ecol Res Grp, Copenhagen, Denmark; Oster Farimagsgade 2D, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",N8 Research Partnership; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; White Rose University Consortium; University of Sheffield; N8 Research Partnership; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; White Rose University Consortium; University of Sheffield; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Aberystwyth University; Ural Federal University,"Quested, HM (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Bot, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",Helen.Quested@botan.su.se,"Press, Malcolm Colin/ABB-3995-2021; Callaghan, Terens V./N-7640-2014","Aerts, Rien/0000-0001-6694-0669",,,,,55,140,152,3,96,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2003,84,12,,,,,3209,3221,,10.1890/02-0426,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-0426,,,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,762LN,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000187973500011,View Full Record in Web of Science

These processes depend on differential recruitment of plant species as a function of disperser preferences, rather than on adjustments based on evolutionary processes. On the plant side, there is a prevalence of historical and phylogenetic effects, which reflects a series of ecological limitations inherent to the interactions between plants and dispersal agents that constrain plant adaptation to dispersers. To test adaptive hypotheses and explanations, future investigations on Mediterranean plant-disperser systems should concentrate more on the animal than on the plant side of the interaction.",,,"HERRERA, CM (corresponding author), CSIC, ESTAC BIOL DONANA, APARTADO 1056, E-41080 SEVILLE, SPAIN.",,"Herrera, Carlos/AAS-3831-2020; Herrera, Carlos M/A-4088-2008","Herrera, Carlos/0000-0003-2452-3888; Herrera, Carlos M/0000-0003-2452-3888",,,,,173,211,235,1,35,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4162,,,ANNU REV ECOL SYST,Annu.

The shape of flowers produced by both L. usitatissimum and B. rapa ssp. oleifera plants grown without parasites was less asymmetric, and for both host species, the flowers of plants grown without parasites had significantly longer petals than flowers produced by hosts with parasites. Significantly more bumblebees visited the inflorescences of B. rapa with untreated flowers compared to inflorescences with highly asymmetrical flowers (two of the four petals clipped shorter), whereas no difference was found in the number of visits made by syrphid flies.

Data were collected from 248 herbarium specimens drawn from the species' geographic range in Canada and the United States and included 45 vegetative, reproductive, and ecological characters. Each variety was found to have a broader distribution than previously reported, which expanded the area of known sympatry among the varieties to include most of the species' range. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed statistically significant differences in morphology among the four varieties (p<0.001 in all cases). However, linear discriminant analysis of morphological data showed a continuum of variation and accurately identified the taxonomic variety of individual specimens only 44-75% of the time. Moreover, principal component analysis of continuous morphological variables failed to uncover partitions of the data that would support alternative circumscriptions of subspecific taxa. A chi-squared contingency test to determine if varietal determinations depended on soil-moisture level failed to find evidence supporting such a conclusion (p=0.121). Results show that morphological variation observed in this species cannot be divided into reliably diagnosable groups. While ecotypes are common in Eurasian Melampyrum species and are explained in part by seasonal variation, no common garden experiments to determine how abiotic and biotic conditions affect phenotype have been conducted using M. lineare. Ongoing molecular phylogeographic study of this species may provide alternative metrics for characterizing the diversity of this wide-ranging species.","[Oldham, Karoline A.] George Mason Univ, Sch Syst Biol, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Weeks, Andrea] George Mason Univ, Dept Biol, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Weeks, Andrea] George Mason Univ, Ted R Bradley Herbarium, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University; George Mason University; George Mason University,"Oldham, KA (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Sch Syst Biol, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",karoline.a.oldham@gmail.com,,"Weeks, Andrea/0000-0002-0000-4541","Graduate Student Research Award from New England Botanical Club; Earl Core Award from Southern Appalachian Botanical Society; Max and Vera Britton Environmental Science Award from Cosmos Club Foundation; Office of the Provost, George Mason University","Graduate Student Research Award from New England Botanical Club; Earl Core Award from Southern Appalachian Botanical Society; Max and Vera Britton Environmental Science Award from Cosmos Club Foundation; Office of the Provost, George Mason University","The authors thank the following institutions for loans of herbarium specimens used in this study: BH, CONN, FARM, GH, GMUF, ID, LYN, MICH, MIN, MONT, MONTU, MT, NCU, NY, ODU, OS, PH, TENN, UBC, URV, V, VPI, VT, WILLI, WIS, WTU, WVA.

Methods and Results: Microsatellites were isolated from genomic DNA using an enrichment protocol. Twenty-nine loci were characterized in two individuals from each of 15 geographically disparate populations (global). Seven polymorphic loci were further characterized in one population (local). The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to 12 in the global sample and one to seven in the local sample. The expected heterozygosity ranged from 0-0.75, the observed heterozygosity from 0-0.1, and the inbreeding coefficient from 0.84-1 in the local sample. Conclusions: The results show the utility of these novel polymorphic microsatellite markers for further conservation genetic analyses. The strong deficit of heterozygosity across all loci in the local sample suggests the species may be inbreeding.","[Crichton, Rhiannon J.; Squirrell, Jane; Hollingsworth, Peter M.] Royal Bot Garden Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH3 5LR, Midlothian, Scotland; [Crichton, Rhiannon J.; Woodin, Sarah J.; Dalrymple, Sarah E.] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Aberdeen,"Crichton, RJ (corresponding author), Royal Bot Garden Edinburgh, 20A Inverleith Row, Edinburgh EH3 5LR, Midlothian, Scotland.",Rhiannon.Crichton@gmail.com,"GenePool, The/D-8812-2012","Crichton, Rhiannon/0000-0002-8264-4912; Dalrymple, Sarah/0000-0002-6806-855X; Hollingsworth, Peter/0000-0003-0602-0654",Natural Environment Research Council; Scottish Natural Heritage grant; EU ATANS grant [Fp6 506004]; BBSRC [BBS/E/D/20310000] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [G0900740] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0900740] Funding Source: researchfish,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Scottish Natural Heritage grant; EU ATANS grant; BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"The authors thank all landowners for permission to sample populations, C.

Of the 140,467 assembled and annotated uniGenes, 2,000 were identified as differentially expressed (DEGs) and were classified in six distinct clusters according to their expression profiles. DEGs were also classified in enriched functional categories related to synthesis, signaling, homoeostasis, and response to auxin and jasmonic acid. Since many orthologs are involved in lateral or adventitious root formation in other plant species, we propose that in P. schiedeanus (and perhaps in other rootless mistletoe species), these genes participate in haustorium formation by complex regulatory networks here described. Lastly, and according to the structural similarities of P. schiedeanus enzymes with those that are involved in host cell wall degradation in fungi, we suggest that a similar enzymatic arsenal is secreted extracellularly and used by mistletoes species to easily parasitize and break through tissues of the host.","[Ibarra-Laclette, Enrique; Venancio-Rodriguez, Carlos Ariel; Alonso-Sanchez, Alexandro G.; Perez-Torres, Claudia-Anahi; Villafan, Emanuel] Inst Ecol AC INECOL, Red Estudios Mol Avanzados REMAv, Xalapa, Mexico; [Vasquez-Aguilar, Antonio Acini; Galicia, Sonia; Sosa, Victoria; Ornelas, Juan Francisco] Inst Ecol AC INECOL, Red Biol Evolut, Xalapa, Mexico; [Perez-Torres, Claudia-Anahi] Investigador Mexico CONACyT Inst Ecol A C INECOL, Xalapa, Mexico; [Ramirez-Barahona, Santiago] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Dept Bot, Inst Biol, Mexico City, Mexico; [Rebollar, Eria A.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Genom, Cuernavaca, Mexico; [Lara, Carlos] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, Ctr Invest Ciencias Biol, Tlaxcala, Mexico; [Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Antonio] UNAM, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabil IIES, Lab Genet Conservac, Morelia, Mexico; [Diaz-Fleisher, Francisco] Univ Veracruzana, INBIOTECA, Xalapa, Mexico",Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico; Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Veracruzana,"Ibarra-Laclette, E (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC INECOL, Red Estudios Mol Avanzados REMAv, Xalapa, Mexico.;Ornelas, JF (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC INECOL, Red Biol Evolut, Xalapa, Mexico.",enrique.ibarra@inecol.mx; francisco.ornelas@inecol.mx,"Rebollar, Eria/B-2044-2015; Rebollar Caudillo, Eria/HFZ-8793-2022; Sosa, Victoria/A-5798-2013","Rebollar, Eria/0000-0001-8827-023X; Sosa, Victoria/0000-0002-0584-1672; Vasquez-Aguilar, Antonio Acini/0000-0002-4920-7278",,,,,166,0,0,1,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-8021,,FRONT GENET,Front.

The invasive species involved may be introduced, or native invaders, and controlling them is a major global challenge. Here, we highlight an emerging role for native parasitic plants in suppressing invasive species, thus aiding in restoration of affected habitats. Compelling empirical evidence is provided by three study systems located in Central Europe, southern Australia and eastern China. Further cases of parasitism of invasive plants have been recorded across five continents. We propose including the interactions between parasitic and invasive plants into the theoretical framework of the biotic resistance hypothesis concerning generalist interactions between invaders and native biota. Among parasitic plants, numerous root hemiparasites, mistletoes and parasitic vines show low host specificity and exert substantial negative effects on their hosts. These parasitic plants may interfere with key traits of invaders such as symbiotic nitrogen fixation or clonal propagation which provide them with competitive advantage over native species. We contend that some parasitic plants may present a cost-effective environmentally sustainable component of invasion management schemes. Therefore, we encourage exploration of this potential and the development of methods for practical applications in ecological restoration and nature conservation.","[Tesitel, Jakub] Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic; [Cirocco, Robert M.; Facelli, Jose M.; Watling, Jennifer R.] Univ Adelaide, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Watling, Jennifer R.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Ecol & Environm Res Ctr, Manchester, Lancs, England",Masaryk University Brno; University of Adelaide; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Tesitel, J (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic.",tesitel@sci.muni.cz,"Cirocco, Robert/AAV-6410-2021; Watling, Jennifer R/B-9485-2008","Cirocco, Robert/0000-0002-1609-2531; Watling, Jennifer/0000-0001-6305-9905",Czech Science Foundation [19-28491X]; Australian Research Council Linkage Project [LP 0667863],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Australian Research Council Linkage Project(Australian Research Council),JT was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (project no. 19-28491X).

However, some heterotrophic species have evolved adaptive strategies to use zoochorous seed dispersal. Seed dispersal by ants, known as myrmecochory, is one of the most widespread animal dispersal systems and has been reported in a diverse range of plant taxa. However, the combination of myrmecochory and heterotrophy seems to be very rare. Here I report the discovery of myrmecochory in the hemiparasitic plant Thesium chinense by Tetramorium tsushimae and Pristomyrmex punctatus. Myrmecochory would be an advantageous dispersal system for T.chinense because its fruits are quickly transferred to the ants' nests, which provide a refuge from the seed predator Canthophorus niveimarginatus. Myrmecochory is also potentially beneficial for T.chinense, as the nests of these ants are frequently located close to poaceous plants, which are the preferred hosts.","[Suetsugu, Kenji] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",Kyoto University,"Suetsugu, K (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Nihonmatsu Cho, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",kenji.suetsugu@gmail.com,"Suetsugu, Kenji/S-8762-2018","Suetsugu, Kenji/0000-0002-7943-4164",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [12J00602],"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)",I thank Drs Makoto Kato and Akira Yamawo for helpful discussions.

Since then, research on tropical mistletoes has burgeoned, as a growing number of researchers use these forest and woodland hemiparasites to address a wide range of ecological and evolutionary questions. In this commentary, I highlight some recent findings, revisit and refine some emergent inferences, and suggest that tropical mistletoes offer many opportunities for further research, representing tractable models to address many unanswered questions in the life sciences. As well as reinforcing the role of mistletoes as facilitators for plant communities and keystone resources for animal assemblages, research on mistletoe pollination, seed dispersal, and host-range, challenge the established views about the ecological maintenance and evolutionary trajectory of specialization.","[Watson, David M.] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"Watson, DM (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia.",dwatson@csu.edu.au,,"David, Watson/0000-0003-1821-4632",,,,,57,5,5,0,40,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",1916-2790,1916-2804,,BOTANY,Botany,MAR,2017,95,3,,,SI,,211,217,,10.1139/cjb-2016-0232,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2016-0232,,,7,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,EQ6HX,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000398183500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

To understand the population dynamics and community ecology of root hemiparasitic plants and their hosts, models of resource-based competition have been extended to include resource parasitism. Parasitism provides a mechanism for parasitic plants to overcome deficits in their ability to compete for soil resources. The interaction ranges from competitive to exploiter-victim, depending on whether the benefits of parasitism overshadow the costs of competition. These models predict that as productivity in the system increases, parasitic plants should become more abundant. In diverse host communities, differences in the impact that parasites have on their hosts and the benefits that they receive from parasitizing different-hosts may;lead to nontransitive competitive relationships and a sort of apparent competition. The possible dynamics include paper-rock-scissors oscillations and indirect mutualisms between parasitic plants and their hosts that allow them to form coalitions that can exclude competitive dominants.","Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Smith, D (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dave@needles.umaryland.edu,"Smith, David J/C-1995-2013; Smith, David L/L-8850-2013","Smith, David J/0000-0002-8810-4386; Smith, David L/0000-0003-4367-3849",,,,,32,18,22,5,47,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

The exploitation of shared resources by diverse organisms underpins the structure of ecological communities. Hemiparasitic plants and the insect herbivores feeding on them both rely, directly and indirectly, on the resources supplied by the parasite's host plant. Therefore, the identity and number of host plant species providing these resources is likely to be critical for parasite and herbivore performance. 2. We tested the effect of single and multiple host species on the biomass of the generalist parasitic plant Rhinanthus minor and the abundance of its aphid (Aphis gossypii) herbivores. 3. Parasite biomass was proportional to the number of haustorial connections to host roots and was determined by host species identity rather than host functional group. Host species identity was also an important influence on aphid population size, and parasites attached to Lotus corniculatus experienced a considerable reduction in aphid herbivory. 4. The effects on the parasite attaching to multiple hosts depended on the combination of species present. However, host mixtures generally benefitted aphids by diluting the negative effects of particular host species. 5. Our findings suggest that the specificity of host attachment alters the impact of this keystone parasitic plant on its own herbivores and, potentially, on the wider plant and herbivore community.","[Rowntree, Jennifer K.; Hartley, Sue E.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Barham, David Fisher; Stewart, Alan J.

Both species are self-compatible, but the capacity for autonomous selfing is higher in R.minor. This suggests a difference in realized outcrossing rates, which have not been determined before in these species. Using microsatellites, both species turned out to have mixed mating systems, but with a much lower multilocus outcrossing rate (0.13) for R.minor compared to R.angustifolius (0.76). We hypothesised that a higher outcrossing rate should lead to a higher chance of heterospecific pollination, and we therefore determined the rate of hybrid formation on each species in an artificial mixed population. Hybrid seeds were produced at low frequency (4.5%), and no significant difference was found between the species. It is therefore likely that post-pollination processes influence hybrid seed formation to counteract the expected difference in heterospecific pollen deposition. We checked fruit set, seed set and the rate of autonomous selfing in controlled crosses in the greenhouse in 2years, and found that fruit set (2003) or seed set (2010) were lower in R.angustifoliusxR.minor crosses relative to the reciprocal cross. Hybrid seeds produced on R.angustifolius also had a much lower germination rate, so most of the established F1 hybrid plants have the R.minor cytoplasm. The formation of advanced hybrids depends on pollinator preference, which is biased towards R.angustifolius if present in sufficient numbers, because it offers more rewards.","[Ducarme, V.; Wesselingh, R.

This study examined the distribution range, relationship with the host plant, flower developmental pattern, pollinator, pollination mechanism, and seed development of M. koreanum (Orobanchaceae) on the island of Somaemul-do, Korea. M. koreanum is hemiparasitic and a strong candidate for its host plant is Pinus thunbergii, with which it is distributed sympatrically. The flower of M. koreanum represents a typical hawk moth pollination syndrome. Macroglossum pyrrhostictum Butler (Sphingidae, Lepidoptera), a diurnal hawk moth, is the only efficient pollinator. The proboscis length of M. pyrrhostictum and the floral tube length of M. koreanum are well coordinated, and the positions of the anther and stigma of M. koreanum are mechanically conformed to hawk moth pollination. The results suggest that adaptation to the pollinator is the main factor that has affected the evolution of the longer floral tube of M. koreanum compare to other species. Pollinator conservation in the native range of M. koreanum is an important issue for the conservation of endemic plant species, and it is necessary to establish a conservation plan for the host plant, Pinus thunbergii, as well as M. koreanum.","[Jo, Sangjin; Yi, Dong-Keun; Kim, Ki-Joong] Korea Univ, Div Life Sci, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Jo, S (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Div Life Sci, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",,,"Yi, Dong-Keun/0000-0002-3988-323X","Eco-Innovation project of the Ministry of Environment, Republic of Korea [416-111-007]; Korea University","Eco-Innovation project of the Ministry of Environment, Republic of Korea; Korea University","We are grateful to Prof. Yeon-Jae Bae for identifying the pollinator species.

The species are not clearly defined, and leaf shape and pubescence are themain differentiating taxonomic characters. In this study individuals from four of the five recognized species were examined to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus and to test the monophyly of recognized species. Samples covered the range of morphological variability and geographic distribution. The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and two chloroplast spacers (atpB-rbcL and trnL-F) were used to reconstruct the molecular phylogeny of the genus using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood criteria. The molecular data show that geography better explains phylogenetic groupings than species assignment. This suggests that morphological variation among populations, in the context of the genetic lineages, should be studied in more detail to test the hypothesis that different ecotypes exist in Arjona.","[Vidal-Russell, Romina] CONICET Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA, Lab Ecotono, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional del Comahue,"Vidal-Russell, R (corresponding author), CONICET Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA, Lab Ecotono, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",vidalrussell@comahue-conicet.gob.ar,,"Vidal-Russell, Romina/0000-0003-2883-1335","CONICET [PICT 1407, PIP 282, PIN B205, PICT 1036]",CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)),"Thanks go to P.

There are published data on parasitism of Krameria from three North American species, but not on K. lappacea, the only economically important species. The present study investigates the presence or absence of hemiparasitism, host plant range and haustorium morphology/anatomy. The study was carried out at two sites in Peru, Department Arequipa, Prov. Arequipa. Hemiparasitism was confirmed, with 106 haustorical connections to 18 host plant species from 17 genera and 12 plant families observed, nearly doubling the number of host plant species known for Krameria (incl. four additional angiosperm families). Root and haustorium architecture and anatomy were found to be similar to the North American species. K. lappacea is a highly generalistic hemiparasite and host distribution and abundance are likely not limiting factors for Krameria recruitment and establishment. Due to its wide range of host plants K. lappacea likely influences the performance of the bulk of perennial species in its habitat and overcollection affects the overall vegetation. Conservation strategies and adequate management should have high priority because of the likely ecological and known economical importance of this species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This C-13 approach, however, failed for the frequently occurring C-3-C-3 parasite-host pairs. Thus, we used hydrogen stable isotope (H-2) natural abundances as a substitute for C-13 within a C-3-Orobanchaceae sequence graded by haustoria complexity and C-3-Santalaceae. Methods Parasitic plants and their real or potential host plants as references were collected in Central European lowland and alpine mountain meadows and forests. Parasitic plants included the xylem-feeding holoparasite Lathraea squamaria parasitizing on the same carbon nutrient source (xylem-transported organic carbon compounds) as potentially Pedicularis, Rhinanthus, Bartsia, Melampyrum and Euphrasia hemiparasites. Reference plants were used for an autotrophy-only isotope baseline. A multi-element stable isotope natural abundance approach was applied. Key Results Species-specific heterotrophic carbon gain ranging from 0 to 51 % was estimated by a H-2 mixing-model. The sequence in heterotrophic carbon gain mostly met the morphological grading by haustoria complexity: Melampyrum- < Rhinanthus- < Pedicularis-type. Conclusion Due to higher transpiration and lower water-use efficiency, depletion in C-13, O-18 and H-2 compared to C-3-host plants should be expected for tissues of C-3-hemiparasites. However, H-2 is counterbalanced by transpiration (H-2-depletion) and heterotrophy (H-2-enrichment). Progressive H-2-enrichment can be used as a proxy to evaluate carbon gains from hosts.","[Giesemann, Philipp; Gebauer, Gerhard] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Lab Isotope Biogeochem, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Gebauer, G (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Lab Isotope Biogeochem, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",gerhard.gebauer@uni-bayreuth.de,"Gebauer, Gerhard/AAP-8061-2020","Gebauer, Gerhard/0000-0003-1577-7501",,,,,59,2,2,6,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. 2 Melampyrum sylvaticum is a hemiparasitic annual of upland, often birch-dominated woodlands. It is found across boreal and montane areas of Europe but within the UK it is predominantly found in the Scottish Highlands. These populations are consequently very isolated and vulnerable to a range of threats. Suitable habitat is characterized by open-canopied deciduous woodland close to water bodies, such as fast-flowing burns or lochs. Sites are typically north-facing, in cool and wet areas of Britain, on moderately acidic soils that are moist but freely draining. 3 Hemiparasitism allows M. sylvaticum to acquire nutrients from a range of hosts but very little is known about which species it is able to parasitize in the field. Melampyrum sylvaticum is associated with herb-rich patches of the understorey. 4 Melampyrum sylvaticum is insect-pollinated. Ants have been reported to be the main dispersal agents and the seed bears an elaiosome which offers them a lipid-rich reward. However, neither insect pollination nor ant dispersal has been observed directly in British populations. 5 Melampyrum sylvaticum has relatively large seeds and been described as an 'annual K-strategist'; it has been suggested that this unusual combination makes it vulnerable to environmental change. Because of its endangered status, M. sylvaticum has been classed as a UK Biodiversity Action Plan species and a recovery project is underway to protect existing populations and to introduce it to suitable habitats in the Central Highlands of Scotland.","Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Aberdeen,"Dalrymple, SE (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Cruickshank Bldg, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland.",s.e.dalrymple@abdn.ac.uk,"Dalrymple, Sarah/E-1757-2012","Dalrymple, Sarah/0000-0002-6806-855X",,,,,81,18,19,2,24,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

During parasitism, the Phtheirospermum haustorium transfers hypertrophy-inducing cytokinins (CKs) to the infected host root. The CK biosynthesis genes required for haustorium-derived CKs and the induction of hypertrophy are still unknown. We searched for haustorium-expressed isopentenyltransferases (IPTs) that catalyze the first step of CK biosynthesis, confirmed the specific expression by in vivo imaging of a promoter-reporter, and further analyzed the subcellular localization, the enzymatic function and contribution to inducing hypertrophy by studying CRISPR-Cas9-induced Phtheirospermum mutants. PjIPT1a was expressed in intrusive cells of the haustorium close to the host vasculature. PjIPT1a and its closest homolog PjIPT1b located to the cytosol and showed IPT activity in vitro with differences in substrate specificity. Mutating PjIPT1a abolished parasite-induced CK responses in the host. A homolog of PjIPT1a also was identified in the related weed Striga hermonthica. With PjIPT1a, we identified the IPT enzyme that induces CK responses in Phtheirospermum japonicum-infected Arabidopsis roots. We propose that PjIPT1a exemplifies how parasitism-related functions evolve through gene duplications and neofunctionalization.","[Greifenhagen, Anne; Braunstein, Isabell; Schaller, Andreas; Spallek, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Plant Physiol & Biochem, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Pfannstiel, Jens] Univ Hohenheim, Mass Spectrometry Unit, Core Facil Hohenheim, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Yoshida, Satoko] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Div Biol Sci, Ikoma, Nara 6300192, Japan; [Shirasu, Ken] RIKEN, Ctr Sustainable Resource Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Shirasu, Ken] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University Hohenheim; University Hohenheim; Nara Institute of Science & Technology; RIKEN; University of Tokyo,"Spallek, T (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Dept Plant Physiol & Biochem, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",thomas.spallek@uni-hohenheim.de,"Schaller, Andreas/AAC-1940-2020; Spallek, Thomas/C-9271-2017; Shirasu, Ken/ABF-5306-2020; Shirasu, Ken/A-4455-2010; Yoshida, Satoko/AAZ-4757-2021; yoshida, satoko/G-5003-2010","Schaller, Andreas/0000-0001-6872-9576; Spallek, Thomas/0000-0003-4425-1015; Shirasu, Ken/0000-0002-0349-3870; Shirasu, Ken/0000-0002-0349-3870; yoshida, satoko/0000-0002-9999-7861; Greifenhagen, Anne/0000-0003-2979-3203",German Research Foundation (DFG) [424122841]; MEXT KAKENHI [JP20H05909],"German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); MEXT KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG, 424122841) to TS and MEXT KAKENHI JP20H05909 to SY and KS.

In contrast, rare parasitic plants represent an uncommon challenge for conservation biologists and managers who often wish to bolster populations of these parasites. Although parasitic plants may suffer any of the maladies known to affect small populations of plants, parasitic plants may also be limited by the additional suite of factors of host availability, host quality, host resistance to parasitism, and parasite preference. We describe studies that have examined parasite growth and reproductive performance with a variety of host species to argue that consideration of the host needs of parasitic plants is necessary for successful conservation of rare species using this mode of resource acquisition. Although it is clear that parasite performance varies greatly with the availability of different host species, little is known about the host requirements of most parasitic plants, and the relative importance of particular host species may not immediately be obvious. Further, because published host lists generally do not distinguish minor hosts from those that sustain parasite populations, such lists may be misleading for conservation efforts. We argue that successful conservation and restoration of parasitic plants may necessitate the management of thoughtfully selected host populations.","UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ,DEPT BIOL,SANTA CRUZ,CA 95064; PRINCETON UNIV,DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,PRINCETON,NJ 08544",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Princeton University,,,"Smith, David J/C-1995-2013; Smith, David L/L-8850-2013","Smith, David J/0000-0002-8810-4386; Smith, David L/0000-0003-4367-3849; Marvier, Michelle/0000-0001-8360-9265",,,,,81,47,54,3,29,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148",0888-8892,,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Through introduction and/or managing a single species, an entire community can be influenced. In our study we show that Pedicularis palustris, an endangered hemiparasite in large parts of Europe, can act as an 'ecosystem engineer,' speeding up the restoration of undrained fen-meadow ecosystems colonised by species-poor and resistant Carex acuta vegetation. The parasitic behavior of Pedicularis palustris on tall sedges significantly alters local plant diversity, biomass production and soil characteristics. Our experiments show that, under the right hydrological conditions and mowing management practice, several target species for nature conservation can benefit from the gaps it creates in above-ground Carex acuta vegetation and its dense below-ground root system. The more prominent presence of mosses and lower density of the topsoil stimulates the recovery of mesotrophic transition mire with active peat formation. Since this habitat type is specifically protected under the European Habitat Directive, (re)introduction of Pedicularis palustris in similar sites within its geographical distribution range in Europe may be a helpful tool to achieve the imposed obligations for appropriate management and restoration.

We aimed to investigate trait divergence linked to pollinator attraction and reproductive isolation (RI) in two hummingbird-pollinated and bird-dispersed Psittacanthus species with range overlap. Methods: We investigated the phylogenetic relationships, floral biology, pollinator assemblages, seed dispersers and host usage, and the breeding system and female reproductive success of two sympatric populations of P. calyculatus and P. auriculatus, and one allopatric population of P. calyculatus. Flowers in sympatry were also reciprocally pollinated to assess a post-mating component of RI. Results: Hummingbird assemblages differed between calyculatus populations, while allopatric plants of calyculatus opened more but smaller flowers with longer lifespans and produced less nectar than those in sympatry. Bayesian-based phylogenetic analysis indicated monophyly for calyculatus populations (i.e. both populations belong to the same species). In sympatry, calyculatus plants opened more and larger flowers with longer lifespans and produced same nectar volume than those of auriculatus; populations shared pollinators but seed dispersers and host usage differed between species. Nectar standing crops differed between sympatric populations, with lower visitation in calyculatus. Hand pollination experiments indicated a predominant outcrossing breeding system, with fruit set after interspecific pollination two times higher from calyculatus to auriculatus than in the opposite direction. Conclusions: Given the low genetic differentiation between calyculatus populations, observed trait divergence could have resulted from changes regarding the local communities of pollinators and, therefore, expected divergence for peripheral, allopatric populations. Using RI estimates, there were fewer heterospecific matings than expected by chance in P. calyculatus (RI4A = 0.629) as compared to P. auriculatus (RI4A = 0.20). When considering other factors of ecological isolation that affect co-occurrence, the RI4C values indicate that isolation by hummingbird pollinators was less effective (0.20) than isolation by host tree species and seed dispersers (0.80 and 0.60, respectively), suggesting that host usage is the most important ecological isolation factor between the two species. Accordingly, the absolute and relative cumulative strength values indicated that the host tree species' barrier is currently contributing the most to maintaining these species in sympatry.","[Diaz Infante, Sergio; del Coro Arizmendi, Maria] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, UBIPRO, Lab Ecol, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Tlalnepantla De Baz, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Lara, Carlos] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, Ctr Invest Ciencias Biol, Tlaxcala, Mexico; [Eguiarte, Luis E.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut, Ciudad De Mexico, DF, Mexico; [Francisco Ornelas, Juan] Inst Ecol AC, Dept Biol Evolut, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico,"Ornelas, JF (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC, Dept Biol Evolut, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico.",francisco.ornelas@inecol.mx,"Ornelas, Juan Francisco/A-2250-2014; Diaz-Infante, Sergio/GZL-8352-2022","Ornelas, Juan Francisco/0000-0002-1124-1163; ","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [155686]; Departamento de Biologia Evolutiva, INECOL [20030/10563]; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) PAPIIT [IN217511, IN216514]; CONACyT","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Departamento de Biologia Evolutiva, INECOL; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) PAPIIT; CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))","This project was funded by research funds from a competitive grant (155686) from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) awarded to J.F.O., the Departamento de Biologia Evolutiva, INECOL to J.F.O.

Helicanthes elasticus (Desv.) Danser is very common on mango trees. Though parasitic in nature, this mistletoe is also medicinally important as fetoprotective, against vesicular calculi and kidney infections. This study is an attempt to document macro-microscopical features of parasitic root, fruit and host-mistletoe tissue interaction in the haustorium of H. elasticus growing on mango stems. Collection, preservation, sectioning, staining and photomicrography of the root, fruit and host mistletoe union were done as per standard methodologies of anatomical studies. Though there is resemblance to the normal roots in morphology as well as anatomy, the microscopic finding of large number of branched stone cells in the roots is interesting. The morpho-anatomical features recorded would help in understanding the infection biology of this mistletoe. The eradication during the earlier stages of its establishment from seed or from the root creeping over the surface of the host can help in controlling this parasite infection on commercially important host plants.

This paper sets out to review a series of experiments that have been undertaken in our laboratory over a number of years that examine these effects and help us to understand mechanisms underpinning the variability in host response.","Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; Korea Atom Energy Res Inst, Radiat Appl Res Team, Taejon, South Korea; Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Banchory AB31 4BW, Kincardine, Scotland; Ecole Natl Super Agron Montpellier, F-34060 Montpellier, France; Royal Bot Gardens, Micropropagat Unit, Richmond TW9 3AB, Surrey, England","RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Aberdeen; Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI); UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew","Cameron, DD (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Alfred Denny Bldg Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",d.cameron@shef.ac.uk,"Rowntree, Jennifer/AAW-8041-2020; Rowntree, Jennifer/F-4766-2011; Cameron, Duncan D/A-8630-2008","Rowntree, Jennifer/0000-0001-8249-8057; Keith, Aidan/0000-0001-9619-1320; Cameron, Duncan/0000-0002-5439-6544",,,,,36,48,53,0,113,ACAD SCI CZECH REPUBLIC INST BOTANY,PRAGUE,"PRUHONICE NEAR PRAHA, PRAGUE 252 43, CZECH REPUBLIC",0015-5551,,,FOLIA GEOBOT,Folia Geobot.,,2005,40,2-3,,,,,217,229,,10.1007/BF02803236,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02803236,,,13,Plant Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,945YZ,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000230540200009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although parasites represent just 1% of all angiosperms, the ecophysiological traits associated with parasitism confer pronounced impacts on their hosts and disproportionate influence upon community structure, composition, and broader ecosystem function. New insights into the roles of their pollinators, seed dispersers, and litter-dependent detritivores have advanced our understanding of how parasitic plants modulate animal communities via their extended and complementary phenology. Direct and indirect impacts of climate change on parasitic plants and their ecological roles are already apparent. Trade-offs between maximizing efficiency at obtaining water from hosts and sensitivity to water stress underlie range shifts and host switching of parasitic plants and increased reliance on these plants by animal communities for food and shelter.","[Watson, David M.; McLellan, Richard C.] Charles Sturt Univ, Gulbali Inst, Albury, NSW, Australia; [Watson, David M.; McLellan, Richard C.] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Agr Environm & Vet Sci, Albury, NSW, Australia; [Fonturbel, Francisco E.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Fonturbel, Francisco E.] Millennium Nucleus Patagonian Limit Life LiLi, Valdivia, Chile",Charles Sturt University; Charles Sturt University; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso,"Watson, DM (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Gulbali Inst, Albury, NSW, Australia.;Watson, DM (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Agr Environm & Vet Sci, Albury, NSW, Australia.",dwatson@csu.edu.au,"Fontúrbel, Francisco E./C-7756-2009","Fontúrbel, Francisco E./0000-0001-8585-2816; McLellan, Richard/0000-0002-9897-0763; David, Watson/0000-0003-1821-4632",,,,,142,1,1,8,8,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1543-592X,1545-2069,,ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S,Annu.

Mistletoe is also widely used by birds as a nesting site, with a recent family-level compilation identifying species in 43 families worldwide nesting in mistletoes. We reviewed breeding and nesting accounts of Australian birds to explore the extent of mistletoe nesting at the species level within an entire avifauna. In total, 217 species of Australian arboreal nesting bird from 29 families are here reported nesting in mistletoes, representing 66% of Australian species that nest in the foliage of trees. A further 28 species are also known to nest in mistletoes incidentally. This increases the total number of avian families known to exhibit this behaviour worldwide to 60, across 16 orders. Although no species can be considered an obligate mistletoe nester, several families regularly nest in mistletoes with >90% of Australian species known to have nested in mistletoes, including Pomatostomidae, Artamidae, Corvidae and Ptilonorhynchidae. Determining preference for mistletoe nesting is a priority for understanding this behaviour and we present guidelines for evaluating whether a particular species preferentially uses mistletoe as a nest-site. We postulate that the evergreen, dense habit of mistletoes provide a strong structural substrate on which to build a nest, offering a higher level of concealment and a more moderate nest microclimate than otherwise similar arboreal nest-sites. These features may also have a role in reducing nest predation and enhancing survivorship of nestlings. Future studies should focus on the mechanisms underlying this pattern using field experiments to evaluate the influence of mistletoe on nest microclimate, rates of predation and nest success.","Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Appl Ornithol Grp, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"Cooney, SJN (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",Stuart.Cooney@anu.edu.au,"Cooney, Stuart JN/B-8540-2008","David, Watson/0000-0003-1821-4632",,,,,66,47,52,0,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AUSTRALIA,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 2, 11 QUEENS RD, MELBOURNE, VIC 3004, AUSTRALIA",0158-4197,1448-5540,,EMU,Emu,,2006,106,1,,,,,1,12,,10.1071/MU04018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU04018,,,12,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,020CM,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000235885500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Tiegh, is an hemiparasite species used in Argentine folk medicine as a substitute for the European mistletoe (Viscum album L.) based on its putative activity of decreasing high blood pressure. This paper analyzes flavonoid composition, protein constituents and the possible immunomodulatory and antitumoral effects of this species. Micromolecular study disclosed quercetin-free, quercetin-glycosylated and proanthocyanidins corresponding to cyanidin monomers, which implies a particular metabolic pathway. Proteins present in L. cuneifolia extracts analyzed by SDS-PAGE presented multiple bands with molecular weights ranging from 14 to 90 kD. These features contribute to the characterization of the native mistletoe. As V. album is being used in cancer treatment due to its immunomodulatory and antitumoral activity, the action of aqueous L. cuneifolia extracts on murine lymphocytes was investigated. Culture of murine spleen cells alone or stimulated with Concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide in presence of L. cuneifolia extracts indicated a certain stimulation of splenocytes alone and an inhibition of splenocytes stimulated with Concanvalin A or lipopolysaccharide. An inhibitory effect was also observed on the proliferation of murine leukemia cells. In addition, aqueous extracts increased nitric oxide production by murine macrophages. These results suggest that L. cuneifolia extracts exert an immunomodulatory effect on the mouse immune system. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Host plants were grown in 3-1 pots in the presence and absence of R. minor at limiting (0.13 mM P) and optimal (0.65 mM P) concentrations of phosphorus for the growth of the host species. Phosphorus was supplied at 2-day intervals in the form of half-strength Long Ashton nitrate-based solution with phosphorus concentrations adjusted accordingly. Parasitism by R. minor significantly suppressed host growth, with final biomass losses ranging between 32% and 44%. Phosphorus supply had a marked impact on the outcome of the host-parasite interaction. By the end of the growing period, parasite biomass at 0.65 mM P was 90% lower than that achieved at 0.13 mM P, In contrast, host biomass at 0.65 mM P was 74% higher than achieved at 0.13 mM P, indicting that the negative impact of parasitism on the host species was reduced when phosphorus supply was increased. The effects of phosphorus on the host-parasite association appeared to be mediated by changes in both the morphological characteristics of the host roots and the relative sink strengths of the host and parasite.","Coll Ripon & York St John, Dept Environm Sci, York YO3 7SX, N Yorkshire, England; Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO1 SYW, N Yorkshire, England",York Saint John University; N8 Research Partnership; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; White Rose University Consortium; University of York - UK,"Davies, DM (corresponding author), Coll Ripon & York St John, Dept Environm Sci, York YO3 7SX, N Yorkshire, England.",d.davies@ucrysj.ac.uk,,,,,,,46,33,35,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2000,124,1,,,,,100,106,,10.1007/s004420050029,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050029,,,7,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,341WP,28308403,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000088614200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

One species, Adenanthos cygnorum, of similar size to most parasitized hosts, served as measure of response of Nuytsia in a non-benefiting situation. Rated on this basis, all 23 parasitized hosts elicited greater mean dry weights of Nuytsia than when on Adenanthos, and seven of these instances were highly significant. Numbers and weights of penetrating and presumably functional haustoria formed on a host were broadly correlated with growth benefit to Nuytsia, but there were notable instances of unusually poor or great benefit from a host relative to the complement of haustoria involved. Experiments in which haustoria-bearing associations of Nuytsia partnered with nodulated Acacia hosts (Acacia acuminata and A. cyclops) were fed N-15(2) showed significant transfer of N-15 to the parasite, but failed to determine whether the label had been acquired through haustoria or directly by Nuytsia roots following turnover of nodule and root residues of the host in the rooting medium. A parallel study using the unusual non-protein amino acid, djenkolic acid, as a marker of benefit from the djenkolic acid-containing host. A. cyclops, showed appearance and progressive build-up of the compound in foliage of Nuytsia over a 6 month period after partnering the species in pot culture. Presence of the compound at final harvest in xylem sap of both partners but not in soil solution of the cultures strongly indicated xylem transfer via haustoria as the principal avenue for N benefit to the parasite. Results are discussed in relation to a recent evaluation of haustorial structure and functioning of N. floribunda.

Host suitability, environmental effects, and hemiparasite abundance most likely influence the impact of parasitism on host height and biomass. However, the role of these factors is unclear in field conditions. We studied host suitability, establishment rates, and effects of a hemiparasitic plant Greater yellow rattle [ Rhinanthus alectorolophus (Scop.)] (RA) on canopy height and biomass of a grass tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) in five trials with manipulated fertilization conducted in golf roughs. Particularly, we examined how grass height and biomass changed with increasing hemiparasite abundance. On average, grasses (nine in total) were better hosts than legumes (four in total). Tall fescue belonged to the group of better hosts. The average establishment rate of Rhinanthus plants ranged from 4.4 to 24.8% regardless of fertilization treatments. In fertilization trials, Rhinanthus did not affect grass height but weakly suppressed grass biomass in non-fertilized plots. The relationship between grass height/biomass and Rhinanthus abundance was best described by a logarithmic decay model. The suppressive effect tended to saturate (negative density dependence) in plots where the Rhinanthus abundance was very high. However, such high densities were quite rare and low Rhinanthus abundances were usually insufficient to substantially suppress grass growth. Our results indicate that we should aim for at least 50 Rhinanthus plants per 1 m(2) to achieve desirable effects on biodiversity and that Rhinanthus performance will be better when nutrients are rather limiting.","[Hejduk, Stanislav] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Anim Nutr & Grassland Management, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Bitomsk, Martin] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Slechtitelu 27, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic; [Pornaro, Cristina; Macolino, Stefano] Univ Padua, Dept Agron Food Nat Resources Anim & Environm, Viale Univ 16,Agripolis Campus, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy",Mendel University in Brno; Palacky University Olomouc; University of Padua,"Hejduk, S (corresponding author), Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Anim Nutr & Grassland Management, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",hejduk@mendelu.cz,,"MACOLINO, STEFANO/0000-0002-5521-9929; Bitomsky, Martin/0000-0002-0022-8473; Hejduk, Stanislav/0000-0003-1560-4790",Univerzita Palackeho v Olomouci [IGA_PrF_2019_021]; H2020 European Institute of Innovation and Technology [774124],Univerzita Palackeho v Olomouci; H2020 European Institute of Innovation and Technology,"Univerzita Palackeho v Olomouci, Grant/Award Number: IGA_PrF_2019_021; H2020 European Institute of Innovation and Technology, Grant/Award Number: 774124",,37,2,2,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-1962,1435-0645,,AGRON J,Agron.

Data were collected from one final harvest of 13 individuals of three different subspecies growing on the hosts Betula pendula, Abies alba and Pin us sylvestris. Compared to Viscum album ssp. album growing on deciduous hosts, the two subspecies abietis and austriacum (syn. laxum) on evergreen hosts showed longer average leaf life spans, but leaves continuously increased in area over time up to an age of at least 4 years irrespective of host. Relative growth rates in plant dry matter (RGR; 0.53-0.61 g g(-1) a(-1)) were in the same range as of deciduous shrubs in central Europe but clearly higher than in mature forest trees. However, this growth is hidden within the spherical crowns of mistletoes, as annual increase in crown volume is extraordinarily low, resulting in very high leaf area densities (LAD; 7.7-17.6 m(2) m(-3)), not found in any other woody species. Besides differences in leaf size and phenology, the three subspecies exhibit similar patterns of partitioning. As in other mistletoe species, significant parts of dry matter are regularly allocated into fruit production (10-15%). Regarding the generally lower net photosynthesis rates in mistletoes as compared to their hosts, it is questioned, whether photoautotrophic carbon gain of the leaves is sufficient to maintain the observed high relative growth rates.

Nothing is known of the dynamics of these events or whether either is a direct outcome of the loss of photosynthesis. The parasitic Scrophulariaceae and Orobanchaceae, representing a continuum of heterotrophic ability ranging from photosynthetic hemiparasites to nonphotosynthetic holoparasites, are used to investigate these issues. We present a phylogenetic hypothesis for parasitic Scrophulariaceae and Orobanchaceae based on sequences of the plastid gene rps2, encoding the S2 subunit of the plastid ribosome. Parasitic Scrophulariaceae and Orobanchaceae form a monophyletic group in which parasitism can be inferred to have evolved once. Holoparasitism has evolved independently at least five times, with certain holoparasitic lineages representing single species, genera, and collections of nonphotosynthetic genera. Evolutionary loss of the photosynthetic gene rbcL is limited to a subset of holoparasitic lineages, with several holoparasites retaining a full length rbcL sequence. In contrast, the translational gene rps2 is retained in all plants investigated but has experienced rate accelerations in several hemi- as well as holoparasitic lineages, suggesting that there may be substantial molecular evolutionary changes to the plastid genome of parasites before the loss of photosynthesis. Independent patterns of synonymous and nonsynonymous rate acceleration in rps2 point to distinct mechanisms underlying rate variation in different lineages.

Pedicularis sceptrum-carolinum is a hemiparasitic species with a strongly fragmented geographic range in Eurasia whose small, isolated, island-like populations are scattered at the periphery of its geographic range. I studied its genetic diversity patterns at the western periphery of the species' range (Poland) using AFLP markers in order to unravel how isolation, population size and life-history traits (i.e. type of reproduction) influence its population genetic structure. Despite the geographic isolation among the four investigated populations (ca. 35-350 km), and irrespective of their small population sizes (14-50 individuals) and areas (6-100 m(2)) they preserved relatively high genetic diversity (Frag(poly) = 46.7%-54.6%, Shannon's I = 0.222-0.241) in comparison with other polyploid, long-lived and outcrossing perennials, and significantly higher than that in the other Pedicularis species. Among the factors generating such high genetic diversity is the polyploid origin of this species. Additionally, sexual reproduction, the breeding system, and seed dispersal seem responsible for the patterns of within-population spatial genetic structure. The moderate genetic differentiation among populations (F-ST = 0.154) and the evidence of recent genetic admixture of populations, as well as genetic similarity among all investigated individuals suggested that gene flow may be relatively high and multi-directional, reflecting recent range expansion of the study species in Europe. I considered that the estimates of genetic differentiation supported the possibility of repeated colonization from different source populations.","Univ Bialystok, Inst Biol, PL-15950 Bialystok, Poland",University of Bialystok,"Wroblewska, A (corresponding author), Univ Bialystok, Inst Biol, Ul Swierkowa 20B, PL-15950 Bialystok, Poland.",adabot@uwb.edu.pl,,,Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [NN303 366135],"Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)","I thank Emilia Brzosko, Alicja Buczek, Edyta Jermakowicz, Wiaczeslaw Michalczuk, Renata Piwowarczyk, Izabela Talalaj and Dan Wolkowycki, who helped to collect samples in Poland, as well as Beata Ostrowiecka for technical assistance in the laboratory.

Sub-Saharan Africa harbours unique and valuable plant resources and is now a target of plant resource depletion. African Sandalwood (Osyris lanceolata), a multi-purpose and drought-tolerant species, has seen increased exploitation for the last thirty years and is now declared endangered. Initiatives to conserve O. lanceolata are not yet successful in Africa due to poor understanding of the species. This review surveys relevant research on the ecology, taxonomy, population dynamics, genetic diversity and ethnobotany of O. lanceolata, and highlights gaps in the literature for further research. A scoping review of grey literature, scholarly papers and reports was applied with pre-determined criteria to screen relevant information. Review findings indicate O. lanceolata is a globally distributed species with no identified center of origin. In Africa, it ranges from Algeria to Ethiopia and south to South Africa; in Europe it occurs in the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands; in Asia from India to China, and also on Socotra. The species has a confusing taxonomy, with unresolved issues in nomenclature, country range distribution, extensive synonymisation and variation in growth form (shrub or tree). The species population is reported to be declining in Africa, but information on population dynamics across its entire range of distribution is anecdotal. Additionally, ecological factors influencing spatial distribution and survival of the species remain unknown. A variety of uses are reported for O. lanceolata globally, including: cultural; medicinal and food; dye; perfumery; timber; ethnoveterinary and phytoremediation. Key research areas and implications for conservation of O. lanceolata in Sub-Saharan Africa are proposed.","[Mugula, Ben Belden; Kiboi, Samuel Kuria; Kanya, James Ireri] Univ Nairobi, Sch Biol Sci, Coll Biol & Phys Sci, POB 30197-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mugula, Ben Belden] Bugema Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Life & Phys Sci, POB 6529, Kampala, Uganda; [Egeru, Anthony] Makerere Univ, Coll Environm & Agr Sci, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda; [Okullo, Paul] Natl Agr Res Org NARO, POB 295, Entebbe, Uganda; [Curto, Manuel; Meimberg, Harald] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Integrat Nat Conservat Res, Dept Integrat Biol & Biodivers Res, Gregor Mendel Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Curto, Manuel] Univ Lisbon, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1749016 Campo Grande, MS, Portugal","University of Nairobi; Makerere University; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Universidade de Lisboa","Mugula, B (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Sch Biol Sci, Coll Biol & Phys Sci, POB 30197-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.;Mugula, B (corresponding author), Bugema Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Life & Phys Sci, POB 6529, Kampala, Uganda.",bbmugula@gmail.com; samuel.kiboi@uonbi.ac.ke; jiykaya@uonbi.ac.ke; a.egeru@ruforum.org; paul.okullo@gmail.com; manuel.curto@boku.ac.at; meimberg@boku.ac.at,,"Kiboi, Samuel/0000-0001-9344-2550; Curto, Manuel/0000-0002-1630-4653; Mugula, Ben Belden/0000-0002-4012-3123; Okullo, Paul/0000-0001-5462-0844",BOKU Vienna Open Access Publishing Fund,BOKU Vienna Open Access Publishing Fund,"Open access funding provided by BOKU Vienna Open Access Publishing Fund.

Rhinanthus minor also attempts unsuccessfully to form connections to a range of non-hosts which in contrast are not damaged by the parasite; however, the underlying physiological basis of these differences is not fully understood. Methods Biomass of host-parasite combinations was studied, and histology, electron microscopy and FT-IR microspectroscopy were used to determine the cellular-level interactions between Rhinanthus haustoria (the parasite's connective structure) and the roots of a range of potential host species. Results Two distinct defence responses were observed in the non-host forbs Plantago lanceolata and Leucanthemum vulgare. Firstly, L. vulgare was able to encapsulate the parasite's invading structures preventing it from gaining access to the stele. This was supported by FT-IR microspectroscopy, used to monitor lignification in response to Rhinanthus haustoria. Secondly, host cell fragmentation was observed at the interface between the parasite and P. lanceolata. Growth data confirmed the non-host status of the two forbs whilst, in contrast, grasses and a legume which were good hosts showed no evidence of defence at the host/parasite interface. Conclusions Variable resistance to Rhinanthus is shown for the first time to be controlled by cellular-level resistance to haustoria by either cell fragmentation or lignification at the host/parasite interface.","Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci Plant & Soil Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; Univ Aberdeen, Dept Chem, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, Scotland",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Aberdeen; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Aberdeen,"Cameron, DD (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Alfred Denny Bldg,Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",d.cameron@sheffield.ac.uk,"Cameron, Duncan D/A-8630-2008","Cameron, Duncan/0000-0002-5439-6544",,,,,44,94,96,1,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Many of these grasslands have lost their diversity due to agricultural intensification. A new tool to facilitate restoration is to introduce hemiparasitic plants such as Rhinanthus species. R. minor accelerates restoration by decreasing the biomass of competitive plants and creating gaps which benefit colonising species. Questions remain about the generality of these impacts and whether R. minor can establish and facilitate community change in more productive grasslands. We addressed these questions by introducing R. minor into 13 mesotrophic grassland sites in southern England. These represented four main soil types and different ages of grasslands (eight permanent grasslands and five temporary ex-arable grasslands). We investigated two treatments using a factorial design: +/- Rhinanthus seed addition and +/- soil surface scarification. Rhinanthus populations established at all but one site. There was high variation in establishment success between the sites (range 0% to 25%), but productivity of the site or nutrient level did not affect establishment. However, scarification improved establishment. Rhinanthus decreased host (mainly grasses and legumes) biomass by between 27 and 37%. Scarification also decreased grass, legume, total and host biomass. There was a strong negative relationship between the abundance of hemiparasites and grass biomass. Non-leguminous herbs were not affected by the treatments, but grassland age had an effect as there were more herbs in permanent grasslands. The results show that it is possible to establish Rhinanthus into different mesotrophic grassland communities representing a variety of soil types and ages, suggesting it is a practical and widely applicable tool for restoration. The considerable variation in the rate of Rhinanthus establishment is unexplained. The factors behind this variation may lie in unfavourable weather conditions during germination and seedling stages, and herbivory.","[Hellstrom, Kalle] Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Bullock, James M.; Pywell, Richard F.] CEH Wallingford, NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England",University of Oulu; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC),"Hellstrom, K (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland.",Kalle.Hellstrom@iki.fi,"Bullock, James M/F-9997-2011; Pywell, Richard F/E-8738-2010","Pywell, Richard F/0000-0001-6431-9959",Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; Natural Environment Research Council [CEH010021] Funding Source: researchfish,Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The study was financially supported by the grant by Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation to K.H.

Despite this unifying character, previous phylogenetic analyses indicate that Phtheirospermum is polyphyletic, with Phtheirospermum japonicum allied with tribe Pedicularideae and members of the Ph. tenuisectum complex allied with members of tribe Rhinantheae. However, no analyses to date have included broad phylogenetic sampling necessary to test the monophyly of Phtheirospermum species, and to place these species into the existing subfamiliar taxonomic organization of Orobanchaceae. Two other genera of uncertain phylogenetic placement are Brandisia and Pterygiella, also both of Eastern Asia. In this study, broadly sampled phylogenetic analyses of nrITS and plastid DNA revealed hard incongruence between these datasets in the placement of Brandisia. However, both nrITS and the plastid datasets supported the placement of Ph. japonicum within tribe Pedicularideae, and a separate clade consisting of the Ph. tenuisectum complex and a monophyletic Pterygiella. Analyses were largely in agreement that Pterygiella, the Ptheirospermum complex, and Xizangia form a clade not nested within any of the monophyletic tribes of Orobanchaceae recognized to date. Ph. japonicum, a model species for parasitic plant research, is widely distributed in Eastern Asia. Despite this broad distribution, both nrITS and plastid DNA regions from a wide sampling of this species showed high genetic identity, suggesting that the wide species range is likely due to a recent population expansion. The Ph. tenuisectum complex is mainly distributed in the Hengduan Mountains region. Two cryptic species were identified by both phylogenetic analyses and morphological characters. Relationships among species of the Ph. tenuisectum complex and Pterygiella remain uncertain. Estimated divergence ages of the Ph. tenuisectum complex corresponding to the last two uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at around 8.0-7.0 Mya and 3.6-1.5 Mya indicated that the development of a hot-dry valley climate during these uplifts may have driven species diversification in the Ph. tenuisectum complex.","[Yu, Wen-Bin; Corlett, Richard T.] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Gar, Mengla, Peoples R China; [Yu, Wen-Bin] Chinese Acad Sci, Southeast Asia Biodivers Res Inst, Yezin, Myanmar; [Randle, Christopher P.] Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA; [Lu, Lu; Wang, Hong] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jun-Bo; Li, De-Zhu] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Plant Germplasm & Genom Ctr, Germplasm Bank Wild Species, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [depamphilis, Claude W.] Penn State Univ, Grad Program Plant Biol, Dept Biol, State Coll, PA USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University","Yu, WB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Gar, Mengla, Peoples R China.;Yu, WB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Southeast Asia Biodivers Res Inst, Yezin, Myanmar.;Li, DZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Plant Germplasm & Genom Ctr, Germplasm Bank Wild Species, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",yuwenbin@xtbg.ac.cn; dzl@mail.kib.ac.cn,"Corlett, Richard T./S-2899-2019; Li, De-Zhu/G-8203-2011; Yu, Wen-Bin/H-8339-2014","Corlett, Richard T./0000-0002-2508-9465; Li, De-Zhu/0000-0002-4990-724X; Yu, Wen-Bin/0000-0002-7643-2112","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31470323, 31200185]; National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954100]; Major International Joint Research Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [31320103919]; 1000 Talents Program [WQ20110491035]; US National Science Foundation [DEB1119746]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y7ZK251B01]; China Scholarship Council",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Major International Joint Research Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 1000 Talents Program; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 31470323 and 31200185), the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB954100), the Major International Joint Research Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (31320103919), the 1000 Talents Program (WQ20110491035), US National Science Foundation (DEB1119746), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Y7ZK251B01), and the China Scholarship Council.",,99,14,17,1,28,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Because lowland rice production is increasing in tropical Africa, it is important to ascertain the influence of R. fistulosa on weed plant communities in these rice growing habitats. We investigated weed plant community richness and composition at four different levels of R. fistulosa infestation across two years of surveys from lowland rice fields in northern Togo (West Africa). Despite a lack of significant differences in community richness among sites with different R. fistulosa infestation levels, there were significant differences in community composition, both when estimated from presence-absence data and from relative abundance data, after controlling statistically for geographic proximity among sites. Rhamphicarpa fistulosa infestation, therefore, may influence the competitive balance between rice and its weeds and shape weed community structure.

Fragmented population stands of buffalo nut in Pennsylvania, USA, represent the northern-most range of distribution of the species. These leading-edge populations could be the originators for new stands expected to arise as climate change shifts this species' native range further north. When observing an isolated stand of buffalo nut, it is impossible to be sure if individual trees are clones of a common parental plant or the product of sexual reproduction. Our study represents the first attempt to use population genetic methodologies to determine the genetic relatedness of individual plants in fragmented stands, and to assess the genetic diversity of native buffalo nut populations in North America. Our study used microsatellite markers to compare genetic variation in samples from populations in Pennsylvania to samples collected in other populations in the northern end of its range (i.e., West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia). We found 1) that trees could not be located at most sites, and 2) that Pennsylvania populations are largely clonal with little genetic diversity among locations within the state (similar to 200 km(2)) relative to populations sampled in Kentucky and Virginia. We provide best practice suggestions for conservation of this species.","[Swartz, Krystle A.; Zembower, Nicole M.; Wu, Di; Carlson, John E.] Penn State Univ, Schatz Ctr Tree Mol Genet, 327 Forest Resources Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Swartz, Krystle A.] Castle Creek Biosci Inc, 405 Eagleview Blvd, Exton, PA 19341 USA; [Weathers, T.

Mistletoes are important hemiparasites, which represent a source of stress for their host plants but, in spite of being common in all major biogeographical regions of the world, no study has measured the response of their hosts in terms of leaf FA. We addressed the effect of mistletoes on host plant foliar FA by comparing parasitized and non-parasitized individuals of four host species in two sites in southeastern Brazil, Serra do Cipo and Serra do Rola Moca. In the four host species, parasitized individuals presented significantly higher levels of leaf FA than unattacked plants. The specialist mistletoe Phoradendron cf. amplexicaule induced higher levels of FA on its host Erythroxylum suberosum (Erythroxylaceae) than the generalist mistletoe Struthanthus flexicaulis did on either Mimosa calodendron (Fabaceae), Lychnophora pinaster (Asteraceae) or Stachytarpheta glabra (Verbenaceae). We hypothesized that specialized parasites could be more damaging to their hosts than generalist mistletoes, which could explain the higher FA levels observed. Significant differences in FA levels among parasitized individuals within species were found, which were significantly correlated with intensity of infection (number of mistletoes per host individual). The results indicate that mistletoes represent an important factor of stress for their host plants, and that FA can be an excellent instrument for evaluating the effects of infections by parasitic plants.","[Cuevas-Reyes, Pablo] Univ Michoacana, Fac Biol, Lab Ecol Interacc Biot, Mexico City 58060, DF, Mexico; [Cuevas-Reyes, Pablo; Wilson Fernandes, G.; Pimenta, Mariana] ICB Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Ecol Evolut & Biodiversidade DBG, BR-30161970 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Antonio] UNAM, Ctr Invest Ecosistemas, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico",Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Cuevas-Reyes, P (corresponding author), Univ Michoacana, Fac Biol, Lab Ecol Interacc Biot, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 58060, DF, Mexico.",pcuevas@oikos.unam.mx,"Fernandes, Geraldo/AAN-5602-2021","Fernandes, Geraldo/0000-0003-1559-6049","DGAPA-PAPIIT, UNAM [IN219108]; CNPq [309633/2007-9, 476178/2008-8]; FAPEMIG [CRA-697/06, 465/07, EDT-465/07, APQ-01278/08]","DGAPA-PAPIIT, UNAM(Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG))","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their criticisms and suggestions on earlier versions of the manuscript.

We explored this question and our results contrast most earlier findings on host-mistletoe interaction. The study was located in the SE Himalayas in an environment with 200-360 mm annual precipitation falling mainly during the short monsoon season (hardly any rain during 9-10 month). The hemi-parasite species (HPs)Loranthus delavayiandTaxillus thibetensisare growing onQuercus pannosas.l.at its drought-driven range limit. HPs mostly exhibited lower shoot water potentials than their hosts during both, the dry and the wet season. During the dry season, leaf conductance (g(l)) of the HPs was very low (100-200 mmol m(-2) s(-1)) and mostly lower than in their host. During the wet season, both HPs and oaks reached highg(l)(up to c. 500 mmol m(-2) s(-1)) with higher in HP or no clear differentiation. Leaf delta C-13 in HPs was lower than in the host, suggesting a small limitation of CO(2)uptake by g(l). Both HPs had higher foliage potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) and similar nitrogen (N) content than the host. Thus, counter to abundant literature, HPs consumed extra water (and dissolved nutrients) mainly during the wet season, not adding extra stress to their host trees under extreme drought. Both host trees and mistletoes track the monsoon regime, with peak activity confined to the brief moist period. Under these semi-arid conditions, mistletoes thus, do not seem to affect the drought-driven range limit of these oaks.","[He, Xiao-Fang; Yang, Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [He, Xiao-Fang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Song-Wei; Koerner, Christian] Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Schonbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Basel","Yang, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Korner, C (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Schonbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",ch.koerner@unibas.ch; yangyang@mail.kib.ac.cn,,,Ten-thousand Talents Program of Yunnan Province [YNWR-QNBJ-2018-318]; Young Academic and Technical Leader Raising Foundation of Yunnan Province [2018HB065]; Yunnan Applied Basic Research Project [2018FA015],Ten-thousand Talents Program of Yunnan Province; Young Academic and Technical Leader Raising Foundation of Yunnan Province; Yunnan Applied Basic Research Project,"This work was supported by the Ten-thousand Talents Program of Yunnan Province (YNWR-QNBJ-2018-318 to YY), Young Academic and Technical Leader Raising Foundation of Yunnan Province (2018HB065 to YY) and the Yunnan Applied Basic Research Project (2018FA015 to YY).",,26,3,3,4,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

The establishment of a diverse range of target species on such sites requires the reduction of soil fertility or of the vigour of competitive plants. Current methods to achieve these aims are often unsuccessful or complicated and expensive. It has been suggested that Rhinanthus species could be used to decrease the growth of competitive plants and enhance species diversity. We review evidence for this potential and suggest five key attributes that make Rhinanthus species a practical restoration tool. Rhinanthus species are natural components of species-rich grasslands (attribute 1), and seed of some species is relatively low cost and easily obtainable (2). Recent work has shown that certain Rhinanthus species reduce the vigour of competitive species, especially agricultural grasses, and allow establishment and persistence of target species (3). We analyze demographic data and show that certain Rhinanthus species have the ability for rapid population growth and spread, even in fertile grasslands (4). We also show that it is relatively easy for land managers to limit the population size of Rhinanthus species and prevent damage (e.g. excessive loss in production or invasion by weeds) to grasslands by excessive densities (5). We give suggestions for further research, including: the range of species-poor grasslands into which Rhinanthus can be introduced successfully and which Rhinanthus species should be used; the mechanisms by which Rhinanthus enhances diversity in restored grasslands; whether the ecotype or subspecies of Rhinauthus used affects restoration success; how management methods affect population growth and spread of Rhinanthus; and whether other parasitic plants could be used in habitat restoration.","CEH Dorset, NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Dorchester DT2 8ZD, Dorset, England; NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Huntingdon PE28 2LS, Cambs, England",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC),"Bullock, JM (corresponding author), CEH Dorset, NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Dorchester DT2 8ZD, Dorset, England.",jmbul@ceh.ac.uk,"Bullock, James M/F-9997-2011; Pywell, Richard F/E-8738-2010","Pywell, Richard F/0000-0001-6431-9959",,,,,50,51,53,0,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1211-9520,1874-9348,,FOLIA GEOBOT,Folia Geobot.,,2005,40,2-3,,,,,273,288,,10.1007/BF02803240,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02803240,,,16,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Plant Sciences,945YZ,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000230540200013,View Full Record in Web of Science

These included the relative contributions of dormancy, recruitment, and other life stages to annual population changes, as well as its ecological responses to fire, mowing, and other factors over time. Following baseline surveys in 1991, we conducted annual censuses from 1993 to 2020 and individualistic plant monitoring from 1999 to 2020. The Schwalbea population initially exhibited positive growth, with major increases observed in the early 2000s, followed by steady, long-term declines. We used generalized linear models and mixed effects models to analyze the relationships between demographic and environmental variables at the population and individual levels, respectively. Dormant season prescribed burning and mowing yielded significant increases in flowering, stems, and survival, with apparent residual benefits in subsequent years following repeated treatments. Germination declined to 0% after 4 y in seed viability experiments, and recruitment was more strongly correlated with estimated seed bank sizes than with flowering alone. Dormant plants represented an average of 21% of the total population, with 20% of above ground plants entering dormancy annually. Most dormancy events (92%) were 1-3 y in duration, indicating that mortality cannot be distinguished from dormancy for a minimum of 3 y after disappearance. Annual survivorship was high (mean = 88%), with 9% of individuals surviving 18 y on average, but differed significantly by cohort and increased with management. Significant differences were observed in size and flowering by age/stage class. However, size alone was insufficient to identify Schwalbea recruits from older plants, due to overlap of their lower size ranges. Long-term declines in survival and recruitment persisted despite suppression of woody succession by hand clipping and intermittent mowing and burning. Increased frequency of mowing or burning may be needed to sustain this population in the future. The relationships of growth and vital rates to other factors are provided, and the benefits of individualistic data for informing Schwalbea monitoring and management are discussed.","[Kelly, Jay F.; Cartica, Robert J.; Van Clef, Michael] NJ Dept Environm Protect, Off Nat Lands Management, Div Pk & Forestry, POB 420, Trenton, NJ 08625 USA; [Kelly, Jay F.] Raritan Valley Community Coll, Ctr Environm Studies, 118 Lamington Rd, North Branch, NJ 08876 USA; [Van Clef, Michael] Ecol Solut LLC, 9 Warren Lane, Great Meadows, NJ 07838 USA",,"Kelly, JF (corresponding author), NJ Dept Environm Protect, Off Nat Lands Management, Div Pk & Forestry, POB 420, Trenton, NJ 08625 USA.;Kelly, JF (corresponding author), Raritan Valley Community Coll, Ctr Environm Studies, 118 Lamington Rd, North Branch, NJ 08876 USA.",jkelly@raritanval.edu,,,"USFWS Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program under Section 6 of the Endangered Species Act; NJDEP Office of Natural Lands Management; Raritan Valley Community College; 2020 USFWS Conservation Recovery Challenge Grant; Pinelands Preservation Alliance; Rutgers Graduate School of New Brunswick, Graduate Program in Ecology and Evolution; Rutgers Pinelands Research Station","USFWS Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program under Section 6 of the Endangered Species Act; NJDEP Office of Natural Lands Management; Raritan Valley Community College; 2020 USFWS Conservation Recovery Challenge Grant; Pinelands Preservation Alliance; Rutgers Graduate School of New Brunswick, Graduate Program in Ecology and Evolution; Rutgers Pinelands Research Station","This research was funded by annual grants from the USFWS Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program under Section 6 of the Endangered Species Act.

Parasitic plants realize host selection through induction by chemical molecular signals, including germination stimulants and haustoria-inducing factors (HIFs). Research on parasitic plant biology has provided information on germination, haustorium induction, invasion, and haustorial structures and functions. To date, some molecular mechanisms have been suggested to explain how germination stimulants work, involving a chemical change caused by addition of a nucleophilic protein receptor, and direct or indirect stimulation of ethylene generation. Haustorium initiation is induced by HIFs that are generated by HIF-releasing enzymes from the parasite or triggered by redox cycling between electrochemical states of the inducers. Haustorium attachment is non-specific, however, the attachment to a host is facilitated by mucilaginous substances produced by haustorial hairs. Following the attachment, the intrusive cells of parasites penetrate host cells or push their way through the host epidermis and cortex between host cells, and some types of cell wall-degrading enzymes may assist in the penetration process. After the establishment of host-parasite associations, parasitic plants develop special morphological structures (haustoria) and physiological characteristics, such as high transpiration rates, high leaf conductance, and low water potentials in hemiparasites, for nutrient transfer and resource acquisition from their hosts. Therefore, they negatively affect the growth and development and even cause death of their hosts.","Chinese Acad Sci, S China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Botanical Garden, CAS","Ye, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, S China Bot Garden, 732 Xingke Rd, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China.",why@scbg.ac.cn,"Shen, Hao/N-5869-2019","Shen, Hao/0000-0003-1321-9303",,,,,144,72,79,4,124,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1435-8603,1438-8677,,PLANT BIOLOGY,Plant Biol.,MAR,2006,8,2,,,,,175,185,,10.1055/s-2006-923796,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-2006-923796,,,11,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,025EH,16547862,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000236247600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Br.) A. DC. ( sandalwood) once grew throughout the medium- to low- rainfall areas of the south- western agricultural region of Australia; however, this resource has been exhausted by over- exploitation and clearing for agriculture. There has been growing interest from the farming community and other investors in the development of a plantation Santalum spicatum industry in southern Western Australia. This study investigated the distribution of remnant S. spicatum within the Pallinup River catchment and assessed the risk of S. spicatum population decline due to salinity. The natural range of host species at different sites ( river catchments) across the south coast was also investigated. Remnant populations of S. spicatum within and adjacent to the Pallinup River catchment were small ( 1 - 70 trees) and highly fragmented. The risk of further population decline due to salinity was concluded to be small because remnant trees were generally growing in well drained, sandy soils that were elevated above ( median 9 m) their immediate drainage line. Across the seven river catchments surveyed, S. spicatum occurred in a range of vegetation associations and parasitised numerous species ( 68) from a wide range of genera and families. The suite of species exploited varied within and between catchments. Thirty species, including most monocots and Myrtaceae, were not successfully parasitised. Remnant S. spicatum always occurred on well drained soil types that supported open- woodland or mallee - heath communities. Sandalwood plantations, supported by numerous individuals of a range of host species ( 10 - 40 species), were shown to be productive in terms of sandalwood growth. The scale of the developing sandalwood plantation industry is likely to be small and unlikely to cover large areas of catchments. Thus, this industry alone is unlikely to address the salinity crisis through broadscale recharge management. However, additional to on- site recharge reduction, biodiverse host plantations may improve the prospects for biodiversity and rivers in salinising landscapes through the protection and enhancement of natural biodiversity, creation of new habitat, conservation of plant species and by providing a commercial incentive to protect biodiversity.","Ctr Excellence Nat Resource Management, Albany, WA 6330, Australia; Greening Australia Western Australia Inc, Albany, WA 6330, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Woodall, GS (corresponding author), Ctr Excellence Nat Resource Management, 444 Albany Highway, Albany, WA 6330, Australia.",,,,,,,,21,11,11,1,8,C S I R O PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",0067-1924,,,AUST J BOT,Aust.

Patterns of dormancy and germination were studied for six species sampled in areas ranging from the Pyrenees to Northern Scandinavia, and from sea level up to about 2500 in altitude in the Alpine region. Dormancy was broken by a 2 to 6 months period of cold stratification. Optimal temperature and length of the stratification period appeared to vary between and within species. Two patterns of dormancy and germination were distinguished. Seeds of the first group, including the widely distributed R. minor and R. angustifolius, further referred to as the LW group, require a relatively long period of cold stratification. Moreover, their germination is accelerated if they are subjected to a widening range of higher temperatures in the last weeks of the stratification period. In the other species (R. alectorolophus, R. glacialis, R. mediterraneus and perhaps R. antiquus) the release of dormancy is completed in a rather short period. Higher temperatures in the last weeks of the stratification period hardly affect the germination process of this SN-group, with short dormancy and no accelerated germination at higher temperatures. In both groups, temperatures above the low values during stratification reduce germination percentages and induce secondary dormancy in non-germinated seeds. The effects strongly vary with timing and temperature. The patterns have a genetic basis and seem to be species-specific. They do not vary with climate conditions, since samples R. minor, whether collected in sub-arctic or sub-alpine areas or at sea level, generally react according to the LW pattern, and samples of R. alectorolophus from areas at sea level up to montane regions according to the SN one. The ecological significance of the various stratification requirements and effects of higher temperatures on germination is discussed in relation to the local climate of the species and the evolutionary history of the genus.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Environm Sci, Grp Nat Conservat & Plant Ecol, NL-6708 PD Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Ter Borg, SJ (corresponding author), Hamelakkerlaan 11, NL-6703 EE Wageningen, Netherlands.",s.terborg@planet.nl,,,,,,,40,29,34,1,35,ACAD SCI CZECH REPUBLIC INST BOTANY,PRAGUE,"PRUHONICE NEAR PRAHA, PRAGUE 252 43, CZECH REPUBLIC",0015-5551,,,FOLIA GEOBOT,Folia Geobot.,,2005,40,2-3,,,,,243,260,,10.1007/BF02803238,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02803238,,,18,Plant Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,945YZ,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000230540200011,View Full Record in Web of Science

This species is endemic to westernWashington and Oregon, USA, and southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Over 5000 golden paintbrush plants were outplanted as plugs in 2007 at six different native prairie sites that were considered to be suitable habitat, based on general evaluations of vegetation and soil conditions. Outplantings were installed at regular intervals along transects up to 1 km long to include a range of conditions occurring at each site. All plantings were re-examined five years later. The patchy distribution of surviving plugs and new recruits within each reintroduction site suggested success is strongly influenced by microsite characteristics. Indicator species analysis of taxa growing in microsites around outplanted golden paintbrush identified species that were positively or negatively associated with paintbrush survival. Species such as Festuca roemeri, Eriophyllum lanatum, and Viola adunca were strong indicators at some sites; non-natives such as Hypochaeris radicata and Teesdalia nudicaulis tended to be frequent negative indicators. Overall, higher richness of native perennial forbs was strongly correlated with both survival and flowering of golden paintbrush, a pattern that may reflect interactions of this hemiparasite with the immediately surrounding plant community. Topographic position also influenced outcomes, with greater survival occurring on mounds and in swales, where soils generally were deeper. Our findings suggest that assessments of site suitability based on vegetation alone, and coarser, site-level assessments that do not characterize heterogeneity at the microsite scale, may not be strong predictors of restoration success over the longer term and in sites with variability in vegetation and soils. By identifying suitable microsites to focus rare species plantings, survival and efficiency may be significantly enhanced.","[Dunwiddie, Peter W.; Martin, R.

We grew 25 maternal half-sib families of the parasite on Agrostis capillaris and Trifolium pratense and without a host in a greenhouse. Biomass and number of flowers of the parasite were the highest when grown on T. pratense. There were significant interactions between host species and R. serotinus seed-family indicating that the differences in performance on the two hosts and without a host varied among the families. However, we found no significant negative correlations between performance of R. serotinus on the host species or between performance on the two hosts and autotrophic performance.

The obligate hemiparasitic weed Striga hermonthica grows on cereal roots and presents a severe threat to global food security by causing enormous yield losses, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The rapidly increasing Striga seed bank in infested soils provides a major obstacle in controlling this weed. Striga seeds require host-derived strigolactones (SLs) for germination, and corresponding antagonists could be used as germination inhibitors. Recently, we demonstrated that the common detergent Triton X-100 is a specific inhibitor of Striga seed germination by binding noncovalently to its receptor, S. hermonthica HYPO-SENSITIVE TO LIGHT 7 (ShHTL7), without blocking the rice (Oryza sativa) SL receptor DWARF14 (OsD14). Moreover, triazole ureas, the potent covalently binding antagonists of rice SL perception with much higher activity toward OsD14, showed inhibition of Striga but were less specific. Considering that Triton X-100 is not suitable for field application and by combining structural elements of Triton and triazole urea, we developed two hybrid compounds, KK023-N1 and KK023-N2, as potential Striga-specific germination inhibitors. Both compounds blocked the hydrolysis activity of ShHTL7 but did not affect that of OsD14. Binding of KK023-N1 diminished ShHTL7 interaction with S. hermonthica MORE AXILLARY BRANCHING 2, a major component in SL signal transduction, and increased ShHTL7 thermal specificity. Docking studies indicate that KK023-N1 binding is not covalent but is caused by hydrophobic interactions. Finally, in vitro and greenhouse tests revealed specific inhibition of Striga seed germination, which led to a 38% reduction in Striga infestation in pot experiments. These findings reveal that KK023-N1 is a potential candidate for combating Striga and a promising basis for rational design and development of further Striga-specific herbicides.","[Zarban, Randa A.; Jamil, Muhammad; Wang, Jian You; Al-Babili, Salim] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, BioAct Lab, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Hameed, Umar F.

When plant species have differential affinities for this nutrient source, hemiparasitic litter might influence species composition in addition to the parasitic suppression of host species. We expected that species adapted to fertile habitats derive a higher proportion of nutrients from the hemiparasitic litter compared to other species. N-15-labeled litter of Rhinanthus angustifolius and Pedicularis sylvatica was added to experimental field plots and adjacent litter bags. We examined N release from the litter, N uptake by the vegetation 2, 4 and 12 months after litter addition and differences in the proportion of N taken up from the litter (N-L) between co-occurring species. The percentage of N in shoots of co-occurring plant species that is derived from the added hemiparasitic litter (N-L) strongly differed between the species (0.1-6.2 %). After exclusion of species with an alternative N source (legumes as well as ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal species), N-L was positively related (p < 0.001) with specific leaf area (SLA) and at Pedicularis sites with leaf N concentration (LNC) and leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC) (p < 0.05), i.e. leaf traits associated with a fast-growth strategy and adaptation to high-nutrient environments. Our results suggest that nutrient release from hemiparasitic litter favors plant species with a fast-growth strategy adapted to high-nutrient environments compared to species with a slow-growth strategy. Whether continued hemiparasitic litter inputs are able to change species composition in the long term requires further research.","[Demey, Andreas; Staelens, Jeroen; Baeten, Lander; Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab ForNaLab, B-9090 Gontrode, Belgium; [Hermy, Martin] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape FNL, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Staelens, Jeroen; Boeckx, Pascal] Univ Ghent, Isotope Biosci Lab ISOFYS, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Baeten, Lander] Univ Ghent, Terr Ecol Unit TEREC, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Kattge, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Ghent University; KU Leuven; Ghent University; Ghent University; Max Planck Society,"Demey, A (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab ForNaLab, Geraardsbergsesteenweg 267, B-9090 Gontrode, Belgium.",andreas.demey@ugent.be,"Kattge, Jens/J-8283-2016","Kattge, Jens/0000-0002-1022-8469; Baeten, Lander/0000-0003-4262-9221","Research Foundation Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen); agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT-Vlaanderen); FWO-Vlaanderen; Special Research Fund of Ghent University (BOF); TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS; IGBP; Global Land Project; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through its program QUEST (Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System); French Foundation for Biodiversity Research (FRB); GIS Climat, Environnement et Societe France","Research Foundation Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen)(FWO); agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT-Vlaanderen)(Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT)); FWO-Vlaanderen(FWO); Special Research Fund of Ghent University (BOF)(Ghent University); TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS; IGBP; Global Land Project; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through its program QUEST (Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); French Foundation for Biodiversity Research (FRB); GIS Climat, Environnement et Societe France","Special thanks to the six reserve managers.

Analyzing such interactions at a large spatial scale may advance our understanding of parasitism patterns over complex landscapes. Combining high-resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR, we studied hemiparasite incidence within and among tree host stands to examine the prevalence and spatial distribution of hemiparasite load in ecosystems. Specifically, we aimed to assess: (1) detection accuracy of mistletoes on their oak hosts; (2) hemiparasitism prevalence within host tree canopies depending on tree height, and (3) spatial variation in hemiparasitism across fragmented woodlands, in a low-diversity mediterranean oak woodland in California, USA. We identified mistletoe infestations with 55-96% accuracy, and detected significant differences in remote-sensed spectra between oak trees with and without mistletoe infestation. We also found that host canopy height had little influence on infestation degree, whereas landscape-level variation showed consistent, non-random patterns: isolated host trees had twice the infestation load than did trees located at the core of forest fragments. Overall, we found that canopy exposure (i.e., lower canopy density or proximity to forest edge) is more important than canopy height for mistletoe infestation, and that by changing landscape structure, parasitic prevalence increased with woodland fragmentation. We conclude that reducing fragmentation in oak woodlands will minimize anthropogenic impact on mistletoe infestation at the landscape level. We argue that advanced remote sensing technology can provide baselines to quantitatively analyze and monitor parasite-host trajectories in light of global environmental change, and that this is a promising approach to be further tested in other temperate and tropical forests.","[Barbosa, Jomar M.; Asner, Gregory P.; Knapp, David E.; Anderson, Christopher; Martin, Roberta E.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Barbosa, Jomar M.; Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther; Dirzo, Rodolfo] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Ecol, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Carnegie Institution for Science; Stanford University; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Barbosa, JM (corresponding author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Barbosa, JM (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jomarmbarbosa@gmail.com,"Sebastián-González, Esther/J-7883-2012; Barbosa, Jomar Magalhães/L-6648-2013; Asner, Gregory/G-9268-2013; Martin, Roberta/A-5073-2015","Sebastián-González, Esther/0000-0001-7229-1845; Asner, Gregory/0000-0001-7893-6421; Barbosa, Jomar Magalhaes/0000-0001-7869-5533; Anderson, Christopher/0000-0001-7392-4368; Martin, Roberta/0000-0003-3509-8530","CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education, Brazil [11725/13-3]; FAPESP Research Foundation, Brazil [2011/17968-2]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation","CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education, Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); FAPESP Research Foundation, Brazil(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao Amazonia de Amparo a Estudos e Pesquisas (FAPESPA)); Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation)","The authors would like to thank P.

Based on the differential resistance response of various cultivars, landraces, and breeding lines, it has been proposed that several distinct races of cowpea-parasitic S. gesnerioides exist in West Africa. In this study, we used amplified fragment length polymorphism profile analysis to examine the genetic variability within and among populations of cowpea-parasitic S. gesnerioides within the suspected distribution range of a particular race, and statistical clustering methods to define the phenetic relationships of the various races in West Africa. Our data indicate that genetic variability within and among populations of each of the previously recognized races of cowpea-parasitic S. gesnerioides is extremely low. On the basis of genotypic profile and host differential resistance responses, 2 previously unknown races were identified. Of the 7 races now identifiable, races SG1 (from Burkina Faso) and SG5 (from Cameroon) are the most closely related, and SG4 (from Benin) and SG3 (from Niger/Nigeria) are the most divergent. SG6, a new race of the parasite identified in Senegal, was found to be the most genetically similar to SG4 from Benin. We also demonstrate that a hypervirulent isolate of the S. gesnerioides from Zakpota, in the Republic of Benin, is genotypically distinct from other populations of SG4, thereby warranting designation as a separate race, which we called SG4z. To further support our race classification scheme, we identified a group of molecular markers that effectively discriminate each of the various races. Finally, we show that an isolate (designated SG4i) of the wild legume Indigofera hirsuta-parasitic S. gesnerioides is genetically distinct and significantly diverged from the various races of cowpea-parasitic S. gesnerioides. Our data suggest that both geographic isolation and host-driven selection are critical factors defining race formation in S. gesnerioides in West Africa.","Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA USA",University of Virginia,"Timko, MP (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Glimmer Hall, Charlottesville, VA USA.",mpt9g@virginia.edu,,,,,,,50,35,37,1,18,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0831-2796,1480-3321,,GENOME,Genome,NOV,2006,49,11,,,,,1351,1365,,10.1139/G06-086,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/G06-086,,,15,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,145EA,17426750,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000244846900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The latter species, which is illustrated from Australia for the first time, was until recently known under the name Delias mysis onca Fruhstorfer, 1910. Evidence from adult morphology (male genitalia), colour pattern of the adult and immature stages, behaviour, and ecology indicates substantial phenotypic divergence between D.?aestiva and D.?mysis. Within Australian limits, all three taxa are allopatric: D aestiva is endemic to the Top End, Northen Territory, D.?mysis mysis is restricted to northern and north-eastern Queensland, whereas Delias?lara lara is known only from three specimens from the Torres Strait islands, Queensland. Delias aestiva is perhaps the most remarkable member of the complex and indeed the genus, breeding in tropical mangrove habitats in coastal estuarine areas where the larvae specialize on mature foliage of the tree Excoecaria ovalis Endl. (Euphorbiaceae). This host preference is novel given the general tendency of Delias to feed on hemiparasitic plants in the order Santalales (Loranthaceae, Santalaceae and Viscaceae). Under laboratory conditions, however, larvae successfully completed development on the mistletoe genera Amyema, Dendrophthoe and Decaisnina (all Loranthaceae) with no significant reduction in larval survival. These findings, together with phylogenetic hypotheses of the Aporiina and Delias, indicate a recent evolutionary host shift from Loranthaceae to Euphorbiaceae. The foliage of Excoecaria produces toxic latex, which is composed of a variety of secondary plant compounds, including diterpenoids, triterpenoids, alkaloids and phorbol esters. The mechanism of detoxification has not been established, although the larvae of D.?aestiva are gregarious, regurgitate fluid as part of their chemical defence, and the adults are highly aposematic. Adults are seasonal, being chiefly on the wing during the cooler dry season; during the wet season, the larval food plant is seasonally deciduous and it is suspected that the butterfly undergoes pupal diapause. The cryptically coloured green pupa and tendency to pupate singly in concealed situations of D.?aestiva are highly unusual traits among Delias and are hypothesized to be adaptive responses associated with pupal diapause during the wet season. The unique habitat association, novel food plant specialization, and restricted distribution of D.?aestiva emphasizess the biogeographical peculiarities of northern Australia, especially patterns of historical (vicariant) differentiation between the Top End and Cape York Peninsula within the Australian Monsoon Tropics.

Taxillus nigrans is a common hemiparasitic species in Southwest China that parasitizes a variety of host species. However, a lack of nucleotide sequence data to date has hindered transcriptome-level research on T. nigrans. In this study, the transcriptomes of T. nigrans individuals parasitizing four typical host species (Broussonetia papyrifera (Bpap), a broad-leaved tree species; Cryptomeria fortunei (Cfor), a coniferous tree species; Cinnamomum septentrionale (Csep), an evergreen tree species; and Ginkgo biloba (Gbil), a deciduous-coniferous tree species) were sequenced, and the expression profiles and metabolic pathways were compared among hosts. A total of greater than 400 million reads were generated in nine cDNA libraries. These were de novo assembled into 293823 transcripts with an N50 value of 1790 bp. A large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified when comparing T. nigrans individuals on different host species: Bpap vs. Cfor (1253 DEGs), Bpap vs. Csep (864), Bpap vs. Gbil (517), Cfor vs. Csep (259), Cfor vs. Gbil (95), and Csep vs. Gbil (40). Four hundred and fifteen unigenes were common to all six pairwise comparisons; these were primarily associated with Cytochrome P450 and environmental adaptation, as determined in a KEGG enrichment analysis. Unique unigenes were also identified, specific to Bpap vs. Cfor (808 unigenes), Bpap vs. Csep (329 unigenes), Bpap vs. Gbil (87 unigenes), Cfor vs. Csep (108 unigenes), Cfor vs. Gbil (32 unigenes), and Csep vs. Gbil comparisons (23 unigenes); partial unigenes were associated with the metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides regarding plant hormone signal transduction. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed four modules that were associated with the hosts. These results provide a foundation for further exploration of the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in plant parasitism.","[Kuang, Jingge; Wang, Yufei; Mao, Kangshan; Miao, Ning] Sichuan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Bioresource & Ecoenvironm, Minist Educ, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China; [Milne, Richard] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Mol Plant Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JH, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wang, Mingcheng] Chengdu Univ, Inst Adv Study, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China",Sichuan University; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Edinburgh; Chengdu University,"Miao, N (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Bioresource & Ecoenvironm, Minist Educ, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China.",kjg1106@163.com; yufei8828@gmail.com; maokangshan@163.com; r.milne@ed.ac.uk; wangmcyao@163.com; miaoning@scu.edu.cn,"Mingcheng, Wang/AEQ-7745-2022","wang, yu fei/0000-0003-3016-6389",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0600203],National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, grant number 2016YFD0600203.",,54,1,1,7,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4425,,GENES-BASEL,Genes,JUL,2022,13,7,,,,,,,1173,10.3390/genes13071173,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes13071173,,,13,Genetics & Heredity,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Genetics & Heredity,3J1NR,35885955,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-05-23,WOS:000833170000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An understanding of the nature of its parasitism would contribute to the development of more sophisticated management methods. However, the molecular and genomic resources currently available for the study of S. hermonthica are limited. Results: We constructed a full-length enriched cDNA library of S. hermonthica, sequenced 37,710 clones from the library, and obtained 67,814 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences. The ESTs were assembled into 17,317 unigenes that included 10,319 contigs and 6,818 singletons. The S. hermonthica unigene dataset was subjected to a comparative analysis with other plant genomes or ESTs. Approximately 80% of the unigenes have homologs in other dicotyledonous plants including Arabidopsis, poplar, and grape. We found that 589 unigenes are conserved in the hemiparasitic Triphysaria species but not in other plant species. These are good candidates for genes specifically involved in plant parasitism. Furthermore, we found 1,445 putative simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in the S. hermonthica unigene dataset. We tested 64 pairs of PCR primers flanking the SSRs to develop genetic markers for the detection of polymorphisms. Most primer sets amplified polymorphicbands from individual plants collected at a single location, indicating high genetic diversity in S. hermonthica. We selected 10 primer pairs to analyze S. hermonthica harvested in the field from different host species and geographic locations. A clustering analysis suggests that genetic distances are not correlated with host specificity. Conclusions: Our data provide the first extensive set of molecular resources for studying S. hermonthica, and include EST sequences, a comparative analysis with other plant genomes, and useful genetic markers. All the data are stored in a web-based database and freely available. These resources will be useful for genome annotation, gene discovery, functional analysis, molecular breeding, epidemiological studies, and studies of plant evolution.","[Yoshida, Satoko; Ishida, Juliane K.; Shirasu, Ken] RIKEN, Plant Sci Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Ishida, Juliane K.; Namba, Shigetou] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Agr & Environm Biol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Kamal, Nasrein M.; Ali, Abdelbagi M.] Agr Res Corp, Biotechnol Lab, Wad Madani 126, Sudan",RIKEN; University of Tokyo,"Shirasu, K (corresponding author), RIKEN, Plant Sci Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, 1-7-22 Suehiro Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",ken.shirasu@psc.riken.jp,"Shirasu, Ken/A-4455-2010; Yoshida, Satoko/G-5003-2010; Yoshida, Satoko/AAZ-4757-2021; yoshida, satoko/AAO-4892-2020; Shirasu, Ken/ABF-5306-2020; ishida, juliane/O-9414-2015","Shirasu, Ken/0000-0002-0349-3870; Yoshida, Satoko/0000-0002-9999-7861; yoshida, satoko/0000-0002-9999-7861; Shirasu, Ken/0000-0002-0349-3870; ishida, juliane/0000-0002-0956-7578","Gatsby Charitable Foundation; RIKEN; KAKENHI [19780040, 21780044, 19678001]; MEXT; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19780040, 21780044] Funding Source: KAKEN","Gatsby Charitable Foundation; RIKEN; KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Dr K.

The host plants are Mangifera indica, Bauhinia pupurea and Stelechocarpus burahol. Samples extracted with methanol to yield crude extracts and DPPH (1,1-Diphenyl-2-Picrylhydrazyl) method was used to test the antioxidant activity. The results showed that all extract of mistletoe has antioxidant activities with a range IC50 value of 10-25 mu g/mL. The HPLC analysis showed that each extract has quite similar chromatogram profile. Meanwhile, the total flavonoid and phenolic compound from all the extract range are 37.64-52.92 g QE/100 g and 349.6-431.6 mg GAE/100 g. These results suggested that mistletoe extracts might have interesting bioactive metabolites as an antioxidant and therefore should be further investigated for isolation and structure elucidation. This research also gives a conclusion that different host plants seem to have almost the same metabolites composition.","[Yismairai, E.; Hemelda, N.

In recent years, research has been conducted on the biology of this hemiparasitic plant in order to understand better what factors should be included in the development of sound preservation practices. Our objective in this study was to assess genetic variation using allozyme and RAPD markers for Illinois populations of A. auriculata and two of its more common congeners, A. purpurea and A. tenuifolia. A total of 13 allozyme loci and 112 RAPD markers were scored for the studied species. Overall, lower percent polymorphic loci/markers were observed in A. auriculata than in its congeners. Analyses of molecular variance on RAPD markers showed that most of the genetic variation was within populations. In addition, the allozyme and RAPD UPGMA and RAPD principle coordinates analyses separated the three species of Agalinis. The genetic results of this study in conjunction with ecological studies of A. auriculata in Illinois serve as a springboard for the conservation of the species, not only in Illinois but also throughout its range.","Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Biodivers, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; Augustana Coll, Dept Biol, Rock Isl, IL 61201 USA; Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Wildlife & Plant Ecol, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",Illinois Natural History Survey; Illinois Natural History Survey,"Molano-Flores, B (corresponding author), Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Biodivers, 1816 S Oak St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",molano@inhs.uiuc.edu,,"Koontz, Jason/0000-0003-2265-0795",,,,,51,1,1,1,15,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,1938-4238,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

Here we address the history of the amphi-Atlantic, hemiparasitic Euphrasia minima complex, which is taxonomically intricate and consists of annuals typically growing in alpine, north boreal, and low-arctic habitats. Recently it has also been discovered at three distantly separated sites in the high-arctic archipelago of Svalbard. We analyzed Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation in populations from most of the range of the complex. The main split observed in both datasets, dated to nearly 6 Ma ago, was between one central/southern European alpine lineage (E. minima s.str.) and one northern amphi-Atlantic lineage (E. wettsteinii). The E. wettsteinii lineage consisted of two cpDNA sublineages, both amphi-Atlantic and partly sympatric, estimated to have diverged 1.7 Ma ago. Two main northern subgroups were also revealed in the AFLP dataset, partly consistent with the cpDNA sublineages: one E Atlantic subgroup (N Russia, extending into Scotland and Colesdalen in Svalbard), and one mainly W Atlantic subgroup (NE Canada, Greenland, and Iceland, extending into N Norway). A third subgroup was restricted to two of the three Svalbard populations, Bockfjorden and Ossian Sarsfjellet. Assignment tests of the Svalbard populations suggest that Colesdalen was derived from N Russian source populations and Bockfjorden from N Norwegian ones; the assignment of the Ossian Sarsfjellet population was uncertain. However, as all Svalbard populations were distinctly divergent from each other as well as from all other populations in AFLP marker frequencies, it is unlikely that their establishment in Svalbard is caused by the current climate warming or recent human activities. Their divergence is probably due to founder effects and genetic drift following independent earlier immigrations, possibly during the postglacial warm period 9500 to 4000 years ago.","[Gussarova, Galina; Brochmann, Christian] Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, Natl Ctr Biosystemat, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Alsos, Inger Greve] Univ Tromso, Tromso Univ Museum, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Alsos, Inger Greve] Univ Ctr Svalbard, N-9171 Longyearbyen, Norway",University of Oslo; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University Centre Svalbard (UNIS),"Gussarova, G (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Bot, St Petersburg, Russia.",galina.gusarova@nhm.uio.no,"Gussarova, Galina/ABC-8696-2021; Brochmann, Christian/A-4105-2009","Gussarova, Galina/0000-0001-5388-7491; Alsos, Inger Greve/0000-0002-8610-1085",Research Council of Norway (Polarforskning POLRES) [178220]; NCB Quest researcher budget,Research Council of Norway (Polarforskning POLRES); NCB Quest researcher budget,"The Governor of Svalbard kindly permitted us to collect Euphrasia samples and work in the NW-Spitsbergen National Park and the Ossian Sarsfjellet Nature Reserve.

However, no direct evidence relating the trichomes to water secretion exists, and carbon budgets associated with this energy- demanding process have not been determined. Methods Macro- and microscopic observations of the leaves of hemiparasitic Rhinanthus alectorolophus were conducted and night-time gas exchange was measured. Correlations were examined among the intensity of guttation, respiration and transpiration, and analysis of these correlations allowed the carbon budget of the trichome activity to be quantified. We examined the intensity of guttation, respiration and transpiration, correlations among which indicate active water secretion. Key Results Guttation was observed on the leaves of 50 % of the young, non-flowering plants that were examined, and microscopic observations revealed water secretion from the glandular trichomes present on the abaxial leaf side. Night-time rates of respiration and transpiration and the presence of guttation drops were positively correlated, which is a clear indicator of hydathode trichome activity. Subsequent physiological measurements on older, flowering plants indicated neither intense guttation nor the presence of correlations, which suggests that the peak activity of hydathodes is in the juvenile stage. Conclusions This study provides the first unequivocal evidence for the physiological role of the hydathode trichomes in active water secretion in the rhinanthoid Orobanchaceae. Depending on the concentration of organic elements calculated to be in the host xylem sap, the direct effect of water secretion on carbon balance ranges from close to neutral to positive. However, it is likely to be positive in the xylem-only feeding holoparasites of the genus Lathraea, which is closely related to Rhinanthus. Thus, water secretion by the hydathodes might be viewed as a physiological pre-adaptation in the evolution of holoparasitism in the rhinanthoid lineage of Orobanchaceae.","[Svetlikova, Petra; Hajek, Tomas; Tesitel, Jakub] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Hajek, Tomas] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CS-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Tesitel, J (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Branisovska 1760, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",jakub.tesitel@centrum.cz,"Hájek, Tomá/H-3923-2011; Tesitel, Jakub/B-2452-2009","Hájek, Tomá/0000-0002-5981-5840; ","Czech Science Foundation [P505/12/1390]; Institute of Botany, Czech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939]","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Institute of Botany, Czech Academy of Sciences(Czech Academy of Sciences)","The study was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (project no.

Most of the ca. 2060 species are hemiparasites that photosynthesize throughout all or part of their life cycles. Certain family members are ecologically important due to direct impacts on community biomass and diversity, plant-herbivore interactions, and nutrient cycling. Other members are among the most economically damaging weeds in the world. Multiple trophic transitions within this family make it ideal for studying molecular evolutionary and physiological changes that accompany the evolution of parasitism. Methods: To establish a phylogenetic framework for such work, we substantially increased taxonomic sampling at loci for which a significant amount of data already existed (nuclear ITS and PHYA, plastid matK and rps2) and added data from the low-copy nuclear locus, PHYB. Key results: The data provide strong support for relationships among six major clades and for the position of Brandisia hancei Hook. f. The positions of Boschniakia himalaica Hook. f. & Thomson, Centranthera cochinchinensis (Lour.) Merr., Mannagettaea hummelii Harry Sm., and Pterygiella nigrescens Oliv. are confirmed or suggested for the first time. Conclusions: There is a single origin of parasitism, and from within the hemiparasites, holoparasitism has originated three times. Moving from the base to the tips of the Orobanchaceae tree, the successive major splits within the parasitic clade are: Cymbarieae + the rest; Orobancheae + the rest; Brandisia + the rest; Rhinantheae + the rest; and Pedicularideae + Buchnereae.","[McNeal, Joel R.] Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Biol & Phys, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA; [Bennett, Jonathan R.] St Pauls Sch, London SW13 9JT, England; [Wolfe, Andrea D.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Mathews, Sarah] Harvard Univ, Arnold Arboretum, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Harvard University,"Mathews, S (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Arnold Arboretum, 22 Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",smathews@oeb.harvard.edu,"Wolfe, Andrea/C-8591-2015; Mathews, Sarah/A-6513-2015","Mathews, Sarah/0000-0002-5518-7541",,,,,60,101,108,1,96,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9122,1537-2197,,AM J BOT,Am.

In this study, mistletoe plant parts were collected from three bases of each host species in Daeiz forest of Hyrcanian forests of Iran. The samples were extracted with ethyl acetate and analyzed by HPLC. The results indicated that the host species had no significant effect on the amount of triterpene acids in the mistletoes. But the organ type (foliage and fruit), had significant effect on the BA content meanwhile it didn't show any significant effect on the OA. The highest level of BA was significantly detected in foliage of mistletoes on P. persica and C. betulus (1.23 and 0.97 mg/g dry weight) respectively. Independence of statistical analysis, the highest content of OA (8.52 mg/g dry weight) was observed in the foliage of V. album on P. persica.

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. Viscum album is a widespread obligate hemiparasite on a wide range of angiosperm and gymnosperm trees. Once thought to take just water and nutrients from its host via a haustorium, it is now suggested to also take carbon. Heavy infestations can reduce host vitality through prolific water use and carbon removal. Flowers are highly reduced but are primarily pollinated by flies, ants and bees. Seeds are dispersed by birds. Removal of the epicarp is necessary for successful seedling establishment, and seeds have a sticky viscin coat, adhering it to the host bark. Vegetative spread also happens under the bark of its host resulting in densities of >700 Mistletoe plants per host. Viscum album is a lowland species, most frequent in open human-made habitats extending into woodlands in Europe. It has been widely planted for folklore use centred around Christmas. Despite conservation concerns following removal of Mistletoe-laden old orchards, the species is thriving and needs control in some areas. Viscotoxins and lectins in leaves and shoots have been widely used in herbal medicine and now potentially in complementary cancer therapy.","[Thomas, Peter A.] Keele Univ, Sch Life Sci, Keele, Staffs, England; [Dering, Monika] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Poznan, Poland; [Giertych, Marian J.; Iszkulo, Grzegorz; Tomaszewski, Dominik] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Kornik, Poland; [Giertych, Marian J.; Iszkulo, Grzegorz] Univ Zielona Gora, Inst Biol Sci, Zielona Gora, Poland",Keele University; Poznan University of Life Sciences; Polish Academy of Sciences; University of Zielona Gora,"Thomas, PA (corresponding author), Keele Univ, Sch Life Sci, Keele, Staffs, England.",p.a.thomas@keele.ac.uk,"Dering, Monika/G-1247-2013; Tomaszewski, Dominik/B-5921-2008; Iszkulo, Grzegorz/A-6130-2008","Dering, Monika/0000-0001-7017-5541; Tomaszewski, Dominik/0000-0001-7768-5747; Iszkulo, Grzegorz/0000-0003-2067-729X; Briggs, Jonathan/0000-0001-7650-1555",,,,,356,0,0,18,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Tristerix corymbosus (Loranthaceae) is a hemiparasitic mistletoe that infects a wide range of host species along its distribution range. Among such species, Rhaphithamnus spinosus (Verbenaceae) is a frequent host with a flowering and fruiting season partially synchronized with mistletoe reproductive phenology. As parasitized hosts have, in principle, a larger flower display and fruit crop size than non-parasitized hosts, we examined whether host and parasite reproductive synchrony make infected hosts more attractive for pollinators and seed dispersers than uninfected hosts. Our results showed that pollinator visit rates did not differ between parasitized and non-parasitized hosts. Conversely, seed rain was higher in parasitized than non-parasitized individuals. The number of seeds fallen under non-parasitized plants was spatially associated with crop size, while parasitized plants did not show such association. Finally, the number of seedlings of R. spinosus was significantly larger near parasitized than non-parasitized hosts. Our results suggest that the presence of the mistletoe might be responsible of the higher reproductive success showed by the parasitized fraction of R. spinosus. This effect, however, seems to be related to seed dispersal processes rather than pollination effects.","[Candia, Alina B.; Medel, Rodrigo; Fonturbel, Francisco E.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Santiago 7800024, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Candia, AB (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Las Palmeras 3425, Santiago 7800024, Chile.",fonturbel@gmail.com,"Fontúrbel, Francisco E./C-7756-2009","Fontúrbel, Francisco E./0000-0001-8585-2816; Medel, Rodrigo/0000-0001-9955-764X","Scott Neotropical Fund by Cleveland Metroparks Zoo; Scott Neotropical Fund by Cleveland Zoological Society; People's Trust for Endangered Species; Rufford Small Grants Foundation; FONDECYT [1120155, 3140528]",Scott Neotropical Fund by Cleveland Metroparks Zoo; Scott Neotropical Fund by Cleveland Zoological Society; People's Trust for Endangered Species; Rufford Small Grants Foundation; FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),"C.

Regional studies have used various vegetative and floral traits to describe and identify species, but there has been no detailed analysis of the continuum of morphological variation across the entire geographic range of this genus. Currently 21 species names are being used in the genus but their taxonomic distinctiveness is unclear. The aim of this study was to use multivariate analyses to identify patterns of morphological variation, assess the existence of morpho-species, and correlate variation with climatic and geographic factors. Two putative species were initially circumscribed based on corolla length, and this hypothesis was tested using principal component and discriminant analyses of 17 vegetative and floral characters obtained from 117 herbarium specimens. No statistically significant support was obtained through multivariate analyses for the existence of the two morpho-species, thus, only one species is recognized, a widespread and variable Q. chilense. Patterns of co-variation between several morphological traits and climate were identified. Taller plants with larger flowers were associated with sites with higher precipitation, and narrower leaves with higher temperatures. The presence of thrum flowers (floral morphs with relatively short styles) was correlated with higher latitudes and lower temperatures. Nevertheless, we have not determined whether these variations are genetically fixed ecotypes or are a consequence of phenotypic plasticity.","[Lopez Laphitz, Rita M.; Ezcurra, Cecilia; Vidal-Russell, Romina] CONICET UNComahue, Inst Invest Biodiversidad & Medioambiente, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional del Comahue,"Laphitz, RML (corresponding author), CONICET UNComahue, Inst Invest Biodiversidad & Medioambiente, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",rlaphitz@comahue-conicet.gob.ar,,"Lopez Laphitz, Rita/0000-0001-9244-3543; Vidal-Russell, Romina/0000-0003-2883-1335","Argentina Research Council (CONICET); ANPCyT [PICT 2007-1047, 2011-1036]; CONICET [PIP 0282]; UNComahue [PIN B149]",Argentina Research Council (CONICET)(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); ANPCyT(ANPCyT); CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); UNComahue,"The authors thank A.

This tribe includes approximately 19 genera of hemiparasitic plants predominantly occurring in the Old World. An exception is the genus Bartsia which, according to previous taxonomic treatments, includes a remarkable radiation (ca. 45 species) in the Andes, two species distributed in Afromontane regions, and only one species (Bartsia alpina) ranging from the alpine mountains of northern and central Europe to northeastern North America. The present phylogenetic study includes the most comprehensive taxon sampling of Rhinantheae to date, with main focus on the relationships of the Mediterranean genera. Both nuclear and plastid datasets reveal a core group of Rhinantheae comprising four major lineages. Our analyses suggest that (1) the northern temperate Bartsia alpina is sister to the rest of the core group; (2) African Bartsia are more closely related to the monotypic African genus Hedbergia than to other congeneric taxa; (3) South American Bartsia are nested within a highly supported clade including Parentucellia and Bellardia; (4) Nothobartsia and Odontitella are likely to be the results of at least one intergeneric hybridization event. Despite topological conflicts regarding some taxa, the polyphyly of Bartsia and a broadly circumscribed Odontites are unambiguously supported by our results. Our tree topologies indicate that the importance of certain morphological characters traditionally used for generic delimitation (such as shape and indumentum of corolla, anthers, and capsules) has been overestimated, and that some of these characters are presumably convergent. Available information on chromosome numbers corroborates the results presented here.","[Scheunert, Agnes; Fleischmann, Andreas; Olano-Marin, Catalina; Braeuchler, Christian; Heubl, Guenther] Univ Munich, D-80638 Munich, Germany; [Braeuchler, Christian] Bot Staatssammlung Munchen, D-80638 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Scheunert, A (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Menzinger Str 67, D-80638 Munich, Germany.",agnes.scheunert@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,"Brauchler, Christian/0000-0002-6176-1669",,,,,95,27,28,0,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-0262,1996-8175,,TAXON,Taxon,DEC,2012,61,6,,,,,1269,1285,,10.1002/tax.616008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tax.616008,,,17,Plant Sciences; Evolutionary Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Evolutionary Biology,059AR,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000312677300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

P. acaciae is present in the Middle East and Eastern Africa and is not known to occur in the EU. P. acaciae has a long flowering period of about 10 months, from June to April the following year, during which flowers are pollinated by insects and birds. P. acaciae produces single seeded red berries that are eaten by birds, which then disseminate the seeds. The only known bird observed to disseminate the seeds of P. acaciae is Pycnonotus xanthopygos, which has been recorded just once (Spain) but it is not established in the EU. P. acaciae could enter into the EU with host plants for planting. Host plants are present and suitable climatic conditions occur in parts of the EU. If a suitable bird would adapt to transfer the seeds, establishment and spread of P. acaciae within the EU would be possible. If P. acaciae would be able to establish and spread, impacts on some crop plants (e.g. Juglans regia, Ficus carica, Punica granatum, Pistacia vera), ornamental plants, as well as native vegetation could occur. P. acaciae fulfils the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.

Photosynthetic performance reductions have been noted in the Striga-Zea mays association; however, no such information exists for facultative hemiparasitic plants and their hosts, nor are the effects of host species understood. Methods Chlorophyll fluorimetry was used to study the effects of parasitism by the hemiparasite Rhinanthus minor on the grass Phleum bertolinii and the forb Plantago lanceolata, and the effects of host species on the photosynthetic apparatus of R. minor. Key Results Parasitism by Rhinanthus led to a significant decrease in the host, and total (host + parasite) biomass in Phleum; however, in Plantago, no significant repression of growth was noted. Maximum quantum yield (F-v/F-m) was reduced in parasitized Plantago, relative to control plants, but not in Phleum. Fv/Fm was significantly lower in R. minor parasitizing Phleum than Plantago, suggesting Phleum to be a superior host to Plantago for R. minor. Steady-state quantum yield (Phi(PSII)) was significantly depressed in parasitized Phleum, but only at low irradiances in Plantago. Phi(PSII) was very low for R. minor grown on Plantago, but not Phleum. Conclusions Shown here is the first evidence of the suppression of host photosynthesis by a facultative hemiparasitic plant, which has significant effects on total biomass production. Host identity is a significant factor in parasite success, with the forb Plantago lanceolata exhibiting apparent chemical as well as previously identified physical defences to parasitism. It is proposed that the electron transport rate (as denoted by Phi(PSII)) represents the limiting factor for biomass accumulation in this system, and that Plantago is able to suppress the growth of Rhinanthus by suppressing the electron transport rate.","[Cameron, Duncan D.; Geniez, Jean-Michelle; Seel, Wendy E.; Irving, Louis J.] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci Plant & Soil Sci, Old Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; [Geniez, Jean-Michelle] Ecole Natl Super Agron Montpellier, F-34060 Montpellier, France",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Aberdeen; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro,"Irving, LJ (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, 1,1 Machikaneyama Cho, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",ljirving@gmail.com,"Cameron, Duncan D/A-8630-2008; Irving, Louis John/F-3534-2010","Irving, Louis John/0000-0002-9735-2648; Cameron, Duncan/0000-0002-5439-6544",NERC [NE/E014070/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/E014070/1] Funding Source: researchfish,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,27,51,60,0,82,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

However, we are still lacking fundamental ecosystem-level knowledge about the structure, function and inter-species interactions in endophytic assemblages associated with plant hosts sharing a common life strategy or ecological specialization. In this study, we chose two groups of plants with contrasting physiology as model systems: parasites and their hosts. We assessed whether plant life-history strategy, namely differences in nutrient acquisition and accumulation, plays a role in structuring above-ground microbiomes under field conditions. We focused on the structure, colonization extent and potential function of foliar endophytic bacteria and fungi in three root hemiparasitic species (Orobanchaceae), one stem holoparasite (Convolvulaceae), and their potential host plants co-occurring in species-rich temperate grassland ecosystems. For this purpose, we combined next generation amplicon sequencing with quantitative real-time PCR, chemical analyses of leaf tissue, and, in the case of bacteria, functional predictions using information deposited in available databases. We found the foliar endophytic assemblages to be diverse, dominated by generalist taxa, but highly similar across all studied species. Despite of the highly contrasting leaf tissue chemistry in the parasitic and non-parasitic plant species, the parasitic trophic mode did not induce systematic shifts in the diversity, composition or predicted biogeochemical function of the endophytic microbiomes under field conditions. However, compared to their potential hosts, leaves of both hemiparasitic and holoparasitic species harboured significantly lower fungal counts, estimated as ss-actin gene copies ng DNA(-1), which suggests that parasitic plants may possess mechanisms to regulate the extent of colonization by endophytic fungi.

Few studies have examined diet mixing in parasitic plants, which typically have very broad host ranges. We offered the parasitic plant Cuscuta indecora (dodder), a range of mixtures of two hosts (Iva frutescens and Borrichia frutescens) in the greenhouse, and observed correlations between the host community and Cuscuta infection in the field. In the greenhouse, Cuscuta performed better on mixtures with a higher relative abundance of Iva. Cuscuta selectively foraged on whichever host was more abundant (diet switching), the exact opposite of the behavior that would be expected if diet mixing was advantageous. In the field, the intensity of Cuscuta infections was decreased by the presence of non-hosts (grasses), not strongly affected by the presence of intermediate hosts, and increased by the presence of Borrichia. We conclude that Cuscuta does not obtain nutritional benefits from a broad diet, but instead is constrained by its relative lack of mobility to attack hosts of intermediate value. In general, the lack of mobility of parasitic plants compared to herbivores probably selects for broad host ranges in parasitic plants.","[Marquardt, Emily S.; Pennings, Steven C.] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Pennings, SC (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",spennings@uh.edu,"Pennings, Steven C/A-8326-2013","Pennings, Steven C/0000-0003-4757-7125",University of Houston Coastal Center,University of Houston Coastal Center,"We thank the University of Houston Coastal Center for funding, T.

Our results support the current classification of Orobanchaceae and a hypothesis of a mid-Tertiary, Laurasian origin of the family.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Calif Acad Sci, Dept Bot, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; California Academy of Sciences,"Wolfe, AD (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",wolfe.205@osu.edu,"Wolfe, Andrea/C-8591-2015",,,,,,60,78,85,2,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1211-9520,1874-9348,,FOLIA GEOBOT,Folia Geobot.,,2005,40,2-3,,,,,115,134,,10.1007/BF02803229,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02803229,,,20,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Plant Sciences,945YZ,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000230540200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Long-lived trees in arid and semi-arid biomes are particularly at risk, including Australian sandalwood (Santalum spicatum, Santalaceae), which is experiencing substantial population decline due to a suite of natural and anthropogenic drivers, with no appreciable recruitment estimated for more than 80 years. To contextualize this range-wide collapse and quantify regional variation in population dynamics across Australia's western rangelands, we investigated the size-class profiles of 12 sandalwood populations in a 1,500-kilometre arc between Shark Bay and the Gibson Desert in central Western Australia including Indigenous Protected Areas, pastoral leases and public and private conservation parks and reserves. Stem diameters, indicative of age using known growth rates, were recorded for 1,355 sandalwood plants, along with a set of another plant structural and ecological parameters. Using size-class profiles and associated demographic data, we estimated the population age structure and trajectory to determine whether each population was increasing, stable or declining. Our surveys revealed sandalwood populations are declining and are composed almost entirely of very old trees in advanced states of senescence. Of 1,355 plants sampled, 1,198 (88.4%) individuals were large (old) trees. A total of 23 seedlings and 21 saplings were recorded across all sites, almost all of which (22 and 19, respectively) were in one population, and located under the canopies of parent trees where they would not be expected to survive to maturity. Our findings reinforce the urgent need to list Santalum spicatum as a threatened species in Western Australia (where wild plants are still being commercially harvested) and to initiate effective conservation actions to secure the species' continued existence across its natural range.","[McLellan, Richard C.; Watson, David M.] Charles Stud Univ, Sch Anim Environm & Vet Sci, Gulbali Inst, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"McLellan, RC (corresponding author), Charles Stud Univ, Sch Anim Environm & Vet Sci, Gulbali Inst, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia.",rmclellan@csu.edu.au,,"David, Watson/0000-0003-1821-4632; McLellan, Richard/0000-0002-9897-0763","Australian Flora Foundation; Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education, Australian Government; Hermon Slade Foundation","Australian Flora Foundation; Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education, Australian Government(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Hermon Slade Foundation","Australian Flora Foundation; Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education, Australian Government; Hermon Slade Foundation",,94,0,0,4,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,DEC,2022,47,8,,,,,1685,1709,,10.1111/aec.13243,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.13243,,OCT 2022,25,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6P2AU,,hybrid,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000869310200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, few reintroduced plants are known to persist for more than a few years. Our adaptive-management case study illustrates how we restored the endangered hemiparasitic annual plant, Chloropyron maritimum subsp. maritimum (salt marsh bird's beak), to Sweetwater Marsh, San Diego Bay National Wildlife Refuge, California, United States, and used monitoring and experimentation to identify the factors limiting the reintroduced population. After extirpation in 1988, reintroduction starting that year led to a resilient, genetically diverse population in 2016 (a boom of approximately 14,000) that rebounded from a bust (62 in 2014). Multiple regressions attributed 82% of the variation in population counts to tidal amplitude, rainfall, and temperature. Populations of salt marsh bird's beak crashed when the diurnal tide range peaked during the 18.6-year lunar nodal cycle (a rarely considered factor that periodically added approximately 12 cm to tidal ranges). We explain booms as follows: During smaller tidal amplitudes, above-average rainfall could desalinize upper intertidal soils and stimulate salt marsh bird's beak germination. Then, moderate temperature in May favors growth to reproduction in June. In addition, salt marsh bird's beak needs a short and open canopy of native perennial plants, with roots to parasitize (not non-native annual grass pseudohosts) and nearby upland soil for a preferred pollinator, ground-burrowing bees. Although our reintroduced salt marsh bird's beak population is an exceptional case of persistence, this rare species-specific environmental and biological requirement makes it vulnerable to rising sea levels and global warming.","[Noe, Gregory B.] US Geol Survey, Hydrol Ecol Interact Branch, 430 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 20192 USA; [Fellows, Meghan Q.

To assess the changes to rbcL associated with the loss of functional constraints for photosynthesis, nucleotide sequences from nonparasitic and parasitic plants of Scrophulariales were used for phylogeny reconstruction and character analysis. Plants in this group display a broad range of parasitic abilities, from photosynthetic (hemiparasites) to nonphotosynthetic (holoparasites). With the exception of Conopholis (Orobanchaceae), the rbcL locus is present in all parasitic plants of Scrophulariales examined. Several holoparasitic genera included in this study, including Boschniakia, Epifagus, Orobanche, and Hyobanche, have rbcL pseudogenes. However, the holoparasites Alectra orobanchoides, Harveya capensis, Harveya purpurea, Lathraea clandestina, Orobanche corymbosa, O. fasciculata, and Striga gesnerioides have intact open reading frames (ORFs) for the rbcL gene. Phylogenetic hypotheses based on rbcL are largely in agreement with those based on sequences of the nonphotosynthetic genes rps2 and matK and show a single origin of parasitism, and loss of photosynthesis and pseudogene formation have been independently derived several times in Scrophulariales. The mutations in rbcL in nonparasitic and hemiparasitic plants would result in largely conservative amino acid substitutions, supporting the hypothesis that functional proteins can experience only a Limited range of changes, even in minimally photosynthetic plants. In contrast, ORFs in some holoparasites had many previously unobserved missense substitutions at functionally important amino acid residues, suggesting that rbcL genes in these plants have evolved under relaxed or altered functional constraints.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Vanderbilt University,"Wolfe, AD (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 1735 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",wolfe.205@osu.edu,"Wolfe, Andrea/C-8591-2015; dePamphilis, Claude W/P-6652-2016",,,,,,72,99,100,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0737-4038,1537-1719,,MOL BIOL EVOL,Mol.

This mistletoe, which largely parasitizes Acacia tree species, has spread rapidly from its original range in the southern desert region of Israel into the rest of the country since the 1960s. The reason for the rapid invasion of this mistletoe (and increase in abundance in its native range) is purported to be the rapid increases in the populations of the main disperser of the mistletoe's fruit, the yellow-vented bulbul Pycnonotus xanthopygos. This bird breeds in human settlements, which have become substantially larger and more widespread in recent years. Because mistletoes are known to be profligate users of water, we hypothesized that the reason for the widespread senescence and mortality of Ziziphus spina-christi was the higher water stress placed on parasitized trees. We found no significant effect of mistletoe infestation on Z. spina-christi current water status. However, we found that the trees with higher levels of infestation have more dry branches, indicating that the water status of the Z. spina-christi in the longer term has been compromised by the mistletoe infestation. Moreover, infested trees had significantly lower fruit production than uninfested trees. In contrast, mistletoes produced fruit more successfully on trees where infestation was heavier. We conclude that mistletoe has a significant negative impact on Z. spina-christi and that control of its disperser, the yellow-vented bulbul, is the most effective means of limiting this problem.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer, Israel; Univ Ghent, Dept Mol Genet, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",University of Kwazulu Natal; Ben Gurion University; Ghent University,"Ward, D (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, P Bag X01, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa.",ward@ukzn.ac.za,"Ward, David/E-9814-2010",,,,,,13,11,11,1,4,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0792-9978,2223-8980,,ISR J PLANT SCI,Isr.

For the ecological zone of the mid-western highlands of Madagascar, six upland rice varieties were selected by a research program. Objectives. The aim six as to determine their potential for extension in this area. Method. The six varieties were co-assessed for two years across a network of 20 reference farms. Results. The multilocation trials showed a diverse range of environments indicated by the average grain yield in rice, ranging between 1.04 and 4.50 t.ha(-1). FOFIFA 182 was significantly superior (2.90 t.ha(-1)) and SCRID 195 largely inferior (1.65 t.ha(-1)). In addition, there was a group of four undistinguished varieties (around 2.40 t.ha(-1)). The study of the genetic-environment interaction made it possible to differentiate a variety that produced a lower yield under low-fertility conditions (SCRID 90) and a less stable one, SCRID 91. SCRID 195, the lowest yielding variety, was also the most infected by Striga asiatica, a hemiparasitic plant. The farmers' assessment at the end of the 2-year period was added to the results of the research study on rice yield and Striga constraints, which were their two main criteria for variety performance. The farmers' assessment also reported on six other secondary criteria: threshing, earliness, drought resistance, grain quality, taste and grain weight. Conclusions. This research-farmer co-assessment made it possible to define the best-performing varieties in terms of yield and Striga control, namely NERICA 4 (already in extension) and FOFIFA 182 (proposed for extension). It also identified new varieties of interest, based on other criteria selected by the farmers and highlighted the need for future studies focused on a cropping system approach related to upland rice performance.","[Autfray, Patrice; Letourmy, Philippe] CIRAD, UR AIDA, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Autfray, Patrice; Letourmy, Philippe] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, AIDA, Montpellier, France; [Rakotofiringa, Hery Zo Nantainena] PLAE, Lot 2 N 53 AF, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar; [vom Brocke, Kirsten] CIRAD, UMR AGAP, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [vom Brocke, Kirsten] Univ Montpellier, AGAP, CIRAD, INRAE,Inst Agro, Montpellier, France",CIRAD; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Universite de Montpellier,"Autfray, P (corresponding author), CIRAD, UR AIDA, F-34398 Montpellier, France.;Autfray, P (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, AIDA, Montpellier, France.",autfray@cirad.fr,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,1,FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX,GEMBLOUX,"BIBLIOTHEQUE, PASSAGE DES DEPORTES 2, GEMBLOUX, 00000, BELGIUM",1370-6233,1780-4507,,BIOTECHNOL AGRON SOC,Biotechnol.

Therefore, winter warming may shift a species' occurrence northwards and/or to higher altitudes. In Europe, the hemiparasitic vascular plant Viscum album (mistletoe) has two common and widespread subspecies: V. a. ssp. album and V. a. ssp. austriacum. The former has a more northern geographic distribution than the latter. Therefore we hypothesised that seeds of V. a. ssp. album are more tolerant to freezing than those of V. a. ssp. austriacum. From these two mistletoe subspecies V. a. ssp. austriacum is, in some managed forest areas, considered a novel threat to tree growth and forest health. Berries of V. a. ssp. album were collected from Sweden, Poland and Switzerland and berries of V. a. ssp. austriacum were collected from Poland, Switzerland and Spain. After storage at -3 degrees C, seeds were extracted from the pulp of berries and exposed to eight different temperatures between -8 degrees C and -30 degrees C, with the storage temperature serving as the control. After freezing treatments, germination of seeds was monitored. In addition, differential thermal analysis was used to measure freeze tolerance of seeds. The seeds of V. a. ssp. album tolerated lower temperatures than seeds of V. a. ssp. austriacum. The temperature at which 50% of seeds lost their ability to germinate (LT50) was -15 degrees C in V. a. ssp. austriacum and between -15 degrees C and - 19 degrees C in V. a. ssp. album. The results of differential thermal analysis to determine the freezing point of seeds supported these findings. The freezing tolerance of mistletoe seeds was relatively well coupled with the winter climate at the edge of their current geographic distribution. Based on our results, the warming of winters may eliminate the abiotic barrier that has thus far limited mistletoes' expansion, opening a window of opportunity for these parasites to increase their abundance and shift their distribution range towards higher latitudes and altitudes. Although mistletoes play important ecological roles in forest ecosystems, their recent increase has raised concern among forest managers, because they may cause a substantial reduction in tree growth in single species dominated stands. Increasing tree species diversity might be an effective method for limiting future mass infestations in homogeneous managed forests.","[Tikkanen, Olli-Pekka; Luoto, Minna; Lehto, Tarja] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Yliopistokatu 7, Joensuu 80100, Finland; [Kilpelainen, Jouni; Repo, Tapani] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Nat Resources, POB 68, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland; [Mellado, Ana; Hodar, Jose A.] Univ Granada, Dept Ecol, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Granada, Spain; [Hamalainen, Aino] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Box 7044, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Jaroszewicz, Bogdan] Univ Warsaw, Fac Biol, Bialowieza Geobot Stn, Sportowa 19, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland; [Rigling, Andreas; Wang, Ao; Li, Mai-He] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL Zu, Forest Dynam, Zuercherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Rigling, Andreas; Wang, Ao] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Eastern Finland; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Granada; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Warsaw; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Tikkanen, OP (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Yliopistokatu 7, Joensuu 80100, Finland.",olli-pekka.tikkanen@uef.fi; jouni.kilpelainen@luke.fi; anamegar@gmail.com; aino.hamalainen@slu.se; jhodar@ugr.es; b.jaroszewicz@uw.edu.pl; minluo@student.uef.fi; tapani.repo@luke.fi; andreas.rigling@wsl.ch; ao.wang@wsl.ch; maihe.li@wsl.ch; tarja.lehto@uef.fi,"Jaroszewicz, Bogdan/AAC-8184-2020; Li, Mai-He/L-6390-2013; Hódar, José A/G-3447-2018; Rigling, Andreas/B-9665-2013","Li, Mai-He/0000-0002-7029-2841; Hódar, José A/0000-0003-3475-4997; Rigling, Andreas/0000-0003-1944-4042; Jaroszewicz, Bogdan/0000-0002-2042-8245; Lehto, Tarja/0000-0003-2281-6409; Kilpelainen, Jouni/0000-0003-0966-7648",International Centre for Research on Forest Ecosystems,International Centre for Research on Forest Ecosystems,"We thank Drs Katri Himanen and Pedro J.

The few studies adopting a broader view have revealed that these plants mediate a series of direct and indirect competitive and facilitative effects on community structure and ecosystem processes. I summarize findings from the two best-studied systems: a set of experimental and manipulative studies from northern Sweden and an integrated research programme in southern Australia, both focusing on the most abundant hemiparasite in the region -Bartsia alpina (Orobanchaceae; Lamiales) and Amyema miquelii (Loranthaceae; Santalales), respectively. Despite broad-based differences between these regions, their vegetation types and biotic constituents, rates of litter-fall, litter decomposition, nutrient return and plant growth all increased near the hemiparasites in both cases. This leads to changes in the abundance of other plants and the increased species richness and total biomass reflects an indirect form of facilitation. In addition to reallocation of nutrients from host tissues, some of the additional nutrients may be excreted by other organisms, such as visiting pollinators, seed dispersers, herbivores and members of below-ground decomposer communities. Small-scale heterogeneity in nutrient availability could provide a mechanistic process underlying the role of parasitic plants as keystone resources. Parasitic plants can be regarded as either malevolent predators (Dracula) or charitable benefactors(Robin Hood), but may be better described as Dryads (Greek deities associated with specific trees, which, in addition to being reliant on their host for their wellbeing, affect nearby trees and visiting animals, rendering the surrounding stand a sacred grove). Synthesis. The Dryad role may be applicable to a wide range of facilitators, whereby indirect interactions with other organisms affect both hosts and adjacent plants, augmenting direct plant-plant interactions. However, while consistent with both case studies and information from studies of other parasitic plants, this role may be most apparent in low productivity systems. Addition, removal and animal exclosure experiments are highlighted as useful approaches to quantify the community-level influence of parasitic plants, in addition to dedicated work on the below-ground influences of parasitic plants.","Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"Watson, DM (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia.",dwatson@csu.edu.au,,"David, Watson/0000-0003-1821-4632","Australian Research Council [DP0342549, DP0449417]; Australian Research Council [DP0342549, DP0449417] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This article is based on an invited presentation for the Facilitation in Plant Communities Symposium, held by the British Ecological Society in Aberdeen, Scotland 20-22 April 2009.

Biological control of plant populations can be achieved by manipulation of a species' enemies in the invaded range. Interactions were therefore investigated between a native parasitic plant and an invasive legume in Mediterranean-type woodlands of South Australia. The effects of the native stem parasite, Cassytha pubescens, on the introduced host, Cytisus scoparius, and a co-occurring native host, Leptospermum myrsinoides, were compared. The hypothesis that the parasitic plant would have a greater impact on the introduced host than the native host was tested. In a field study, photosynthesis, growth and survival of hosts and parasite were examined. As predicted, Cassytha had greater impacts on the introduced host than the native host. Dead Cytisus were associated with dense Cassytha infections but mortality of Leptospermum was not correlated with parasite infection. Cassytha infection reduced the photosynthetic rates of both hosts. Infected Cytisus showed slower recovery of photosystem II efficiency, lower transpiration rates and reduced photosynthetic biomass in comparison with uninfected plants. Parasite photosynthetic rates and growth rates were higher when growing on the introduced host Cytisus, than on Leptospermum. Infection by a native parasitic plant had strong negative effects on the physiology and above-ground biomass allocation of an introduced species and was correlated with increased plant mortality. The greater impact of the parasite on the introduced host may be due to either the greater resources that this host provides or increased resistance to infection by the native host. This disparity of effects between introduced host and native host indicates the potential for Cassytha to be exploited as a control tool.","[Prider, Jane; Watling, Jennifer; Facelli, Jose M.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Prider, J (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",jane.prider@adelaide.edu.au,"Watling, Jennifer R/B-9485-2008","Facelli, Jose/0000-0002-0408-0082; Watling, Jennifer/0000-0001-6305-9905",Australian Research Council Linkage Project [LP 0667863],Australian Research Council Linkage Project(Australian Research Council),"We thank R.

We assessed the factors that influence the colonization of the mistletoe Struthanthus flexicaulis on Baccharis dracunculifolia and the subsequent effects on host performance. We evaluated the incidence of S. flexicaulis according to size (height classes) and architecture of the host as well as its effects on various physiological parameters of the host. Furthermore, we assessed the occurrence of insect galls induced by Baccharopelma dracunculifoliae (Psyllidae), including the number of leaves infected, and the mortality of infected and non-infected branches. Taller hosts had a higher abundance of mistletoes (60%, p> 0.05). Physiological parameters of hosts were not affected by parasitism, although galling occurred more often (p <0.05) and leaf loss increased (p>0.05) on infected branches. Taller individuals are more colonized by mistletoes and more architecturally complex hosts support a greater number of mistletoes. Mistletoe causes a top-down effect on host-associated organisms on parasitized branches. Mistletoes had a strong top-down effect on B. dracunculifolia due to a reduction in the number of leaves on parasitized branches and the replacement of the bush crown, as well as an increased incidence of insect galls. Furthermore, the occurrence of a heavy parasite load increased the mortality rate of the host branches.","[Bahia, Thaise de Oliveira; Zuniga, Irene Gelvez; Coutinho, Etiene Silva; Wilson Fernandes, G.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Geral, Lab Ecol Evolut & Biodiversidade, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Souza, Matheus Lopes] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Bot, Lab Fisiol Vegetal, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Quesada, Mauricio] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest Ecosistemas, Morelia 58089, Michoacan, Mexico; [Wilson Fernandes, G.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94035 USA",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Stanford University,"Fernandes, GW (corresponding author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Geral, Lab Ecol Evolut & Biodiversidade, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",gw.fernandes@gmail.com,"Fernandes, Geraldo/AAN-5602-2021","Fernandes, Geraldo/0000-0003-1559-6049; Quesada, Mauricio/0000-0002-7776-9286","Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ecologia, Conservacao e Manejo da Vida Silvestre of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; CAPES; CNPq; FAPEMIG; Reserva Vellozia","Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ecologia, Conservacao e Manejo da Vida Silvestre of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); Reserva Vellozia","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their reviews on earlier versions of the ms.

Sandalwood populations have substantially diminished or become locally extinct, predominantly a consequence of land clearing for agriculture, introduced grazers, disruption of key ecological processes (e.g. seed dispersal, fire regimes) and 175 years of intensive commercial exploitation for its fragrant, high value timber. The status of the world's last wild-harvested species of sandalwood is significant to both conservation and rangeland management, and the implementation of a science-based sustainable yield approach to management of this species is vital. By highlighting the scale and precipitous rate of decline and identifying key drivers affecting mortality and recruitment, this review outlines the conservation and restoration needs of the species in situ to conserve remaining wild populations, and the need to transition to science-based resource management actions such as farm-based plantation production.","[McLellan, R.

Wildland fire is considered to be the primary natural agent influencing the population and distribution of dwarf mistletoes across landscapes. Based on this understanding, prescribed fire has been suggested as a potential method for dwarf mistletoe sanitation and control; however, experimental work has primarily focused on prescribed surface fire. In this study, we report long-term impacts of three experimental crown fires on dwarf mistletoe severity in infested lodgepole pine stands in Colorado 33years post-fire. The three fires achieved tree mortality rates ranging from 20% to 100%. Our results suggested a significant negative relationship between the amount of fire-caused tree mortality and future dwarf mistletoe severity. These findings supported the presumed natural role of fire in altering dwarf mistletoe populations, which perhaps exhibits a linear relationship between fire-caused host tree mortality and future dwarf mistletoe severity.","[Ritter, S.

In this study, we add key taxa to a previously generated dataset to produce a more inclusive phylogenetic analysis of the genus. The resulting nuclear ITS and plastid trnL-F phylogenies reveal that the historical sectional classifications based on morphology are not supported. Instead, it appears that widespread morphological parallelism has occurred throughout Korthalsella. Geographical distribution seems to be a better indicator of phylogenetic relatedness as species found in the same geographic region, island or island group generally are more closely related to one another than species sharing similar morphological characters in other areas. We find greater support for recognition of species as local endemics rather than wide-ranging taxa. Given these results, taxonomic changes that recognise previously described taxa are proposed, but other changes will require further study of broadly distributed taxa.","[Sultan, Amir; Robertson, Alastair W.] Massey Univ, Sch Agr & Environm, Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand; [Sultan, Amir] Natl Agr Res Ctr, Natl Herbarium Stewart Collect, Bioresources Conservat Inst, Pk Rd, Islamabad 45500, Pakistan; [Callmander, Martin W.] Conservatoire & Jardin Bot Ville Geneve, Chemin Imperatrice 1,CP 71, CH-1292 Chambesy, Switzerland; [Phillipson, Peter B.] Missouri Bot Garden, POB 299, St Louis, MO 63166 USA; [Phillipson, Peter B.] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS,Dept Syst & Evolut,Inst Syst Evolut & Biodiv, Museum Natl Hist Nat,Ecole Prat Hautes Etud,UMR 7, CP 39,57 Rue Cuvier, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Meyer, Jean-Yves] Govt Polynesie Francaise, Delegat Rech, BP 20981 Papeete, F-98713 Tahiti, French Polynesi, France; [Tate, Jennifer A.] Massey Univ, Sch Fundamental Sci, Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand",Massey University; National Agricultural Research Council - Pakistan; Missouri Botanical Gardens; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Massey University,"Tate, JA (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Sch Fundamental Sci, Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand.",j.tate@massey.ac.nz,"Robertson, Alastair W/A-7808-2008","Robertson, Alastair W/0000-0001-6894-2158; Tate, Jennifer A./0000-0001-5138-2115; Sultan, Amir/0000-0003-2116-9502","Higher Education Commission, Government of Pakistan; Massey University","Higher Education Commission, Government of Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan); Massey University","This work represents a portion of the Ph.D. thesis of AS at Massey University.

Three varieties are currently recognized (A. sessiliflora var. monticola, A. sessiliflora var. senegalensis, and A. sessiliflora var. sessil(flora) and are distinguished by geographic range, calyx pubescence and stamen filament pubescence. Due to the overlapping nature of the characters used to distinguish among these varieties, accurate assignment of a specimen to a single variety is nearly impossible. We undertook a phenetic study of morphological characters to assess the validity of these varieties. Principal coordinate analysis and the unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages were used to explore whether specimens would cluster into the currently recognized varieties. Our analyses revealed no clustering based exclusively on geographic distribution. A small cluster of seven specimens was seen in the principal coordinate analysis using Gower's coefficient of similarity as input values, but this cluster was not diagnosable by unique characters. Based on these results we recommend that Alectra sessiliflora be recognized without infraspecific taxa. Finally, additional names are included as synonyms under Alectra sessiliflora based on extensive study of field-collected and herbarium specimens.","[Morawetz, Jeffery J.] Rancho Santa Ana Bot Garden, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Morawetz, Jeffery J.; Wolfe, Andrea D.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Morawetz, JJ (corresponding author), Rancho Santa Ana Bot Garden, 1500 North Coll Ave, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",jmorawetz@rsabg.org,"Wolfe, Andrea/C-8591-2015",,NSF-DDIG [DEB-0514157]; ASPT Graduate Student Research Grant; Botanical Society of America; Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology; Ohio State University; Ohio State University Office of International Affairs; Janice Carson Beatley Herbarium Fund,NSF-DDIG(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ASPT Graduate Student Research Grant; Botanical Society of America; Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology; Ohio State University(Ohio State University); Ohio State University Office of International Affairs; Janice Carson Beatley Herbarium Fund,"We thank John Freudenstein for assistance with choosing characters and for discussion of analyses; Mesfin Tadesse for help in obtaining loans; Lisa Wallace for extensive help with using NTSYSpc and for discussion of our results; Chris Anderson for nomenclatural assistance; Richard Jensen for providing a program and much assistance for calculating Gower's coefficient; Richard Jensen, Lucinda McDade, Mark Porter and one anonymous reviewer for helpful comments on an earlier draft of this manuscript; and the following herbaria for providing images of type specimens, loaned material and/or access to their collections to JJM: A, B.

This experiment was conducted to determine nutrient composition and nutritive value of mistletoe with respect to vegetation stage. Mistletoe samples were collected from three different tree species [almond (Amygdalus communis L.), plum (Prunus domestica L.), and willow (Salix alba L.)] at three different vegetation stages (April, July, October) naturally growing in Central Turkey. Five samples were taken at each vegetation stage for each tree species. The samples were incubated in rumens of two 2-year old fistulated Holstein cows. Nutrient data and nutritive value indices were subjected to 2-way ANOVA using the GLM procedure. Crude protein and NDF concentrations and metabolisable energy level of the samples were in the ranges of 52.5-68.6, 291-330, and 7.8-8.4 MJ kg(-1)supercript stop DM, respectively. There were also significant differences in DM, crude ash, Fe, Cu, and Zn levels among trees. As the vegetation progressed, there were linear decreases in DM, CP, and NDF and linear increases in ADF, Ca, Cu, and Zn levels. There were significant interaction effects for tree species by vegetation stage in terms of DM, ADF, and Zn. In vitro dry matter and organic matter digestibility coefficients were between 0.84 and 0.87 and between 0.52 and 0.55, respectively. It was also observed that degradation of V. album was almost completed after the first 48 h. The soluble and readily degraded portion of DM (fraction a) increased, whereas the insoluble but degradable portion of DM (fraction b) decreased with advancing vegetation stage. Effective degradability of dry matter (EDDM) also increased significantly as the vegetation progressed. Gas production from fraction b varied by tree species and the stage of vegetation. A significant interaction of tree species by vegetation effects on EDDM and gas production was also noted. After 48 h, cumulative gas production and fraction b ranged from 52.71 ml to 58.85 ml and from 48.8 ml to 75.4 ml, respectively. In general, the mistletoe was low in protein, moderate in fibre, and high in minerals. In conclusion, as long as a lack of deleterious effects on health and performance is shown in feeding trials, mistletoe has potential to be used as a dietary component in ruminant feeding.","Selcuk Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Anim Nutr & Nutr Disorders, TR-42031 Konya, Turkey; Ataturk Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Anim Nutr & Nutr Disorders, TR-25700 Erzurum, Turkey; Selcuk Univ, Fac Sci & Art, Dept Biol, TR-42031 Konya, Turkey",Selcuk University; Ataturk University; Selcuk University,"Umucalilar, HD (corresponding author), Selcuk Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Anim Nutr & Nutr Disorders, TR-42031 Konya, Turkey.",hderya@selcuk.edu.tr,"Arik, Huzur Derya/GLR-5583-2022; Gulsen, Nurettin/GLT-0251-2022","Arik, Huzur Derya/0000-0002-4046-9386; Gulsen, Nurettin/0000-0002-8555-0743",,,,,46,19,19,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,1572-9680,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

Despite the importance of birds in their dispersal and distribution, the effects of host species on fruit size variation have not been investigated to any large extent. The aim of this study was to characterize fruit size variation of Psittacanthus schiedeanus ripe fruits growing on different host species. We expect that the fruit size traits will vary according to the quality of host species, and that this variation will correspond to those in mistletoe reproductive success.Methods: Fully ripe fruits from Psittacanthus schiedeanus mistletoe plants growing on different host tree species were collected at two locations (Tlalnelhuayocan and Coapexpan) of cloud forest in central Veracruz, Mexico, measured (length and width and length of cupular pedicels) and weighed to describe fruit size differences.Key results: Cupular pedicel length and fruit size were significantly affected by host species. On average, longest cupular pedicels and larger fruits were found on plants growing on naturally growing Acacia pennatula, Quercus germana, Ostrya virginiana and Liquidambar styraciflua, whereas the smaller ones were found generally on cultivated host trees.Conclusions: The results provide us with valuable information for further species comparisons regarding the effects of host species on fruit size vari-ation. Although the effects of host species on fruit size variation might vary across space, fruit size differences might be the result of host-resource differences. Further study on fruit selection and fruit handling by seed dispersers is needed to discuss whether the observed fruit size variation correlates with fruit selection and handling by main consumers, and with successful attachment and establishment to host branch after gut passage.","[Ornelas, Juan Francisco; Vasquez-Aguilar, Antonio Acini] Inst Ecol AC INECOL, Red Biol Evolut, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91073, Veracruz, Mexico",Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico,"Ornelas, JF (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC INECOL, Red Biol Evolut, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91073, Veracruz, Mexico.",francisco.ornelas@inecol.mx,,"Vasquez-Aguilar, Antonio Acini/0000-0002-4920-7278","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [155686, A1-S-26134]; Departamento de Biologia Evolutiva, Instituto de Ecologia, A.C.

In this paper the anatomical features as well as micromolecular and macromolecular analysis of this species are reported. Anatomical study has shown that the main characteristic is the presence of crystalliferous branched stone cells in leaves and stems. The analysis of flavonoids showed that only glycosylated quercetin and proanthocyanidins (whose monomer is cyanidin) al-e present, indicating a distinctive metabolic pathway. SDS-PAGE analysis evidenced a protein pattern with components ranging from 14 to 90 kD molecular weights. Antiserum against Ligaria cuneifolia was prepared in mice and its immunogenic ability was evidenced by Ouchterlony and Western-blot assays. The results presented are part of a comprehensive ongoing project on Argentine hemiparasite species, which may also be applied to quality control of commercial samples in order to detect the substitution of Viscum album by Ligaria cuneifolia.","Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Farm & Bioquim, Catedra Inmunol, IDEHU, RA-1113 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Farm & Bioquim, Museo Farmacobot Juan A Dominguez, RA-1113 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires,"Fernandez, T (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Farm & Bioquim, Catedra Inmunol, IDEHU, Junin 956 4 Piso, RA-1113 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",terefern@huemul.ffyb.uba.ar,,,,,,,36,12,13,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1388-0209,1744-5116,,PHARM BIOL,Pharm.

The hemiparasitic growth form is critical to understanding their biology, buffering variation in resource availability that constrains the distribution and growth of most plants. This is manifested in many aspects of mistletoe life history, including extended phenologies, abundant and high-quality fruits and nectar, and few chemical or structural defenses. Most mistletoe species rely on animals for both pollination and fruit dispersal, and this leads to a broad range of mistletoe-animal interactions. In this review, I summarize research on mistletoe biology and synthesize results from studies of mistletoe-animal interactions. I consolidate records of mistletoe-vertebrate interactions, incorporating species from 97 vertebrate families recorded as consuming mistletoe and from 50 using mistletoe as nesting sites. There is widespread support for regarding mistletoe as a keystone resource, and all quantitative data are consistent with mistletoe functioning as a determinant of alpha diversity. Manipulative experiments are highlighted as a key priority, and six explicit predictions arc provided to guide future experimental research.","Charles Sturt Univ, Johnstone Ctr, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia; Charles Sturt Univ, Environm Studies Unit, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia",Charles Sturt University; Charles Sturt University,"Watson, DM (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Johnstone Ctr, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia.",dwatson@csu.edu.au,,"David, Watson/0000-0003-1821-4632",,,,,233,294,325,2,126,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4162,,,ANNU REV ECOL SYST,Annu.

Gross comparisons of nutrient content between infected and uninfected hosts, or parts of hosts, have been widely used to infer basic differences or similarities between hosts and parasites. Coupling of nutrient information with additional evidence of key processes such as transpiration, respiration and photosynthesis has helped elucidate host-parasite relationships and, in some cases, the anatomical nature of their connection and even the physiology of plants in general. For example, detailed analysis of xylem sap from hosts and parasites has increased our understanding of the spatial and temporal movement of solutes within plants. Tracer experiments using natural abundance or enriched application of stable isotopes (N-15, C-13, O-18) have helped us to understand the extent and form of heterotrophy, including the effect of the parasite on growth and functioning of the host (and its converse) as well as environmental effects on the parasite. Nutritional studies of woody hosts and parasites have provided clues to the distribution of parasitic plants and their roles in ecosystems. This review also provides assessment of several corollaries to the host-parasite association.","[Bell, T. L.; Adams, M.

In Experiment 1, the effect of herbicide gap creation on the establishment and persistence of R. minor in grasslands ranging in productivity was investigated with respect to sward management. In Exp. 2, R. minor was sown at 1000 seeds/m(2) in conjunction with a standard meadow mix over a randomized plot design into Lolium perenne grassland of moderate productivity. The treatment of scarification was investigated as a treatment to promote R. minor. Results: Gap size had a significant role in the establishment and performance of R. minor, especially the 30 cm diameter gaps (Exp. 1). However, R. minor failed to establish long-term persistent populations in all of the agriculturally improved grasslands. In Exp. 2, establishment of R. minor was increased by scarification and its presence was associated with a significant increase in Shannon diversity and the number of sown and unsown species. Values of grass above-ground biomass were significantly lower in plots sown with R. minor, but values of total above-ground biomass (including R. minor) and forb biomass (not including R. minor) were not affected. Conclusions: The value of introducing R. minor into species-poor grassland to increase diversity has been demonstrated, but successful establishment was dependent on grassland type. The scope for using R. minor in grassland restoration schemes is therefore conditional, although establishment can be enhanced through disturbance such as sward scarification.","Univ Reading, Dept Agr, Ctr Agrenvironm Res, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; Lusty Hill Farm, Bruton BA10 0BS, Somerset, England; Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Reading; N8 Research Partnership; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; White Rose University Consortium; University of Sheffield,"Westbury, DB (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Agr, Ctr Agrenvironm Res, Earley Gate, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.",d.b.westbury@reading.ac.uk; angdavies@aol.com; b.a.woodcock@reading.ac.uk; n.dunnett@sheffield.co.uk,"Westbury, Duncan/AAU-7578-2021; Woodcock, Ben Alex/F-9199-2010","Westbury, Duncan/0000-0001-7094-0362; Woodcock, Ben Alex/0000-0003-0300-9951",,,,,53,41,42,0,53,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,GRANGARDE,"GAMLA VAGEN 40, S-770 13 GRANGARDE, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

The specific objectives of this research were to study the genetic diversity of rice vampireweed accessions in Benin and Senegal and the relationship between the different genotypes of rice vampireweed through agroecological areas. To achieve these objectives, the genetic diversity of rice vampireweed accessions using the AFLP technique was studied. Based on our results, dendrogram classification has distinguished four different genetic groups. The populations of Benin and Senegal are genetically diverse. Substantial genetic differentiation (G(ST)) exists among agroecological areas within Benin and Senegal (G(ST) = 0.17). The high genetic diversity of rice vampireweed in Benin and Senegal presents a challenge for the development of resistant rice germplasm.","[Zossou, Norliette] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Agron Sci, Dept Nat Res Management, Lab Appl Ecol, POB 526, Cotonou, Benin; [Adoukoneou-Sagbadja, Hubert; Baba-Moussa, Lamine] Univ Abomey Calavi, Dept Genet, POB 1604, Cotonou, Benin; [Adoukoneou-Sagbadja, Hubert; Baba-Moussa, Lamine] Univ Abomey Calavi, Dept Biochemy, POB 1604, Cotonou, Benin; [Fonceka, Daniel] CIRAD, Paris, France; [Sall, Mbaye] CERAAS, Technician, Thies, Senegal; [Ahanchede, Adam; Sinsin, Brice] Univ Abomey Calavi, POB 526, Cotonou, Benin",University of Abomey Calavi; University of Abomey Calavi; University of Abomey Calavi; CIRAD; University of Abomey Calavi,"Zossou, N (corresponding author), Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Agron Sci, Dept Nat Res Management, Lab Appl Ecol, POB 526, Cotonou, Benin.",norliette.zossou@yahoo.fr,"ADOUKONOU SAGBADJA, Hubert/HZM-2556-2023","ADOUKONOU SAGBADJA, Hubert/0000-0003-3850-8742",OWSD (Organization of Women in Science for the Developing World) Ph.D study grants,OWSD (Organization of Women in Science for the Developing World) Ph.D study grants,"This study was funded by OWSD (Organization of Women in Science for the Developing World) Ph.D study grants.

In this study, the anatomical features as well as micromolecular and macromolecular analysis of this species are reported. Anatomical study has shown that Phoradendron liga presents as anatomic features: papillous cuticle, clusters in leaves and stems, and isodiametric stone cells only in stems. The analysis of flavonoids showed that this species produces C-glycosylflavones and 3-desoxyproanthocyanidins. Protein study showed a protein pattern with components ranging from 14 to 90 kDa and the presence of related epitopes between the species was demonstrated by cross recognition using anti-Phoradendron and anti-Viscum antisera of both species by Western blot assay. In addition, a galactose specific lectin (L-PhI) was isolated form Phoradendron liga extracts.

It has a principally Old World distribution, with the greatest diversity being found in southern Africa. Little is known about the relationships within Thesium or its relationships with its closest relatives. In this article, we present a first estimate of species-level phylogenetic relationships in Thesium based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and trnL-trnF sequence data, and use this to explore the biogeographical history of the group. One hundred and four samples representing 72 Thesium spp. were included in a phylogenetic analysis. Plastid and combined data resolve Thesium as paraphyletic relative to Thesidium and Austroamericium with high posterior probability and bootstrap support. ITS sequence data place Thesidium as sister to a large Thesium clade, but with weak support. Ancestral range reconstruction and dating analysis suggest a southern African origin for the group, with a crown age of 39.1 +/- 11.9 Mya, followed by dispersal into Europe and South America. A large clade of Cape species split in the Miocene from a clade comprising tropical species (25.5 +/- 7.3 Mya) with the diversification of extant species beginning at 16.7 +/- 6.3 Mya.

For this purpose, the anatomical characteristics of the stem, leaf, petiole, and fruit were also investigated. The most prominent features were the presence or absence of calcium oxalate crystals, their types, and distribution. In general, 3 types of wax crystalloid structures are identified on the leaf surface, including irregular glandular as well as platelet in L. grewingkii and smooth in L. europaeus. The crystalloid structures of the wax allow differentiation of both species. Seed surface ornamentation demonstrates little difference among these taxa. The seed surface is deeply wrinkled in L. europaeus and shallowly wrinkled in L. grewingkii.

Here we investigate the genetic structure of the annual hemiparasitic herb Rhinanthus angustifolius to evaluate the genetic distinctness of two currently described subspecies and three habitat-related groups of populations inferred from recent common-garden data. Data from 11 nuclear microsatellite loci, obtained from 17 southern Swedish populations of R. angustifolius, were analyzed with a variety of population genetic techniques to examine how intraspecific genetic structure relates to taxonomy, habitat and geography. Neither the two subspecies nor the three recently identified population groups formed genetically coherent lineages. Rather, there was a clear isolation-by-distance pattern, pointing to a major role of geographically restricted gene flow in structuring the diversity at the putatively neutral microsatellite loci. Although uncertainties remain regarding the influence of homoplasy and possible introgression from the closely related R. minor, our microsatellite data argue against the recognition of previously identified subspecies or population groups as management units for conservation purposes. As currently described entities do not contain much unique genetic variation, we recommend conserving populations from a large geographical range, rather than populations from specific habitats, to preserve the long-term evolutionary potential of the species.","[Jonstrup, Anneli; Andersson, Stefan; Hedren, Mikael] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Andersson, S (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers, Lund, Sweden.",stefan.andersson@biol.lu.se,"Andersson, Stefan/E-1349-2016","Andersson, Stefan/0000-0003-3828-5016",Kungliga Fysiografiska Sallskapet i Lund; Anna och Svante Murbecks minnesfond,Kungliga Fysiografiska Sallskapet i Lund; Anna och Svante Murbecks minnesfond,The work was supported by Kungliga Fysiografiska Sallskapet i Lund and Anna och Svante Murbecks minnesfond (to AJ).,,59,1,1,5,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0107-055X,1756-1051,,NORD J BOT,Nord.

In this study, we fill this gap using information gathered from felled trees at a logging concession area in Amazonian Brazil. We sampled individuals of 18 tree species, which occurred in two forest physiognomies; open forest with canopy interrupted by palm trees and closed, denser forest, with emergent trees. We hypothesized that infection incidence would be higher in open than in closed forest, irrespective of the mistletoe species involved. In addition, we expected that mistletoe parasitism would be higher on host species that were more abundant, taller, deciduous, and had less dense wood. We sampled 870 individual trees in both sites combined. All but one host species was infected by at least one species of mistletoe. We found 13 mistletoe species/morphospecies, Loranthaceae (7) and Viscaceae (6), parasitizing very different hosts. Mistletoe infection incidence was higher in the closed forest (10.3%) than in the open forest (5.4%). In the closed forest, host height influenced incidence positively, while deciduousness had a negative influence. Our results show that mistletoes are common in the canopy of pristine tropical forests and, contrary to expectations, that infection incidence was higher in the closed forest. The positive relation between infection incidence and host height in this forest type suggests that emergent trees have higher chances of being infected than individuals of correspondent species in the lower forest layers.","[Lira, Jessica; Fadini, Rodrigo F.] Univ Fed Oeste Para, Programa Posgrad Recursos Nat Amazonia, Rua Vera Paz S-N, BR-68100000 Santarem, PA, Brazil; [Caires, Claudenir S.] Univ Estadual Sudoeste Bahia, Dept Ciencias Nat, Estr Bem Querer S-N, BR-45083900 Vitoria Da Conquista, BA, Brazil; [Fadini, Rodrigo F.] Univ Fed Oeste Para, Inst Biodiversidade & Florestas, Rua Vera Paz S-N, BR-68100000 Santarem, PA, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Oeste do Para; Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia; Universidade Federal do Oeste do Para,"Fadini, RF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Oeste Para, Programa Posgrad Recursos Nat Amazonia, Rua Vera Paz S-N, BR-68100000 Santarem, PA, Brazil.",rfadini@gmail.com,"Fadini, Rodrigo/C-7574-2013","Fadini, Rodrigo/0000-0002-6873-1438; Caires, Claudenir/0000-0002-2012-5164",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"We appreciate the help of our field assistants, Mr. Sabbat and Eucielde Pantoja de Oliveira, and the logistical support of Coomflona.

The parasites are known to exhibit reductions in the genomic features as well as relaxed or intensified selection shifts. In this study, we report plastome and mitogenome sequence of Helicanthes elastica (subtribe Amyeminae, tribe Lor-antheae), an endemic, monotypic genus of Western Ghats, India growing on remarkably diverse host range. The length of plastome sequence was 1,28,805 bp while that of mitogenome was 1,65,273 bp. This is the smallest mitogenome from Loranthaceae reported till date. The plastome of Helicanthes exhibited loss of ndh genes (psi ndhB), psi infA, rps15, rps16, rpl32, trnK-UUU, trnG-UCC, trnV-UAC and trnA-UGC while mitogenome exhibited pseudogenized cox2, nad1 and nad4 genes. The comparative study of Loranthaceae plastomes revealed that the pseudogenization or loss of genes was not specific to any genus or tribe and variation was noted in the number of introns of clpP gene in the family. Several photosynthetic genes have undergone relaxed selection supporting lower photosynthetic rates in parasitic plants while some respiratory genes exhibited intensified selection sup-porting the idea of host-parasite arm race in Loranthaceae. The plastome gene content was found conserved in root hemiparasites compared to stem hemiparasites. The atp1 gene of mitogenome was chimeric and part of it exhibited similarities with Lamiales members.

(Scrophulariaceae), a hemiparasitic perennial herb forming dense clones in open habitats. The impact of environmental factors was assessed in fertilization and defoliation experiments, and gender specialization of individual genets was investigated in a series of diallel experiments (reciprocal crossings) in the field. Maternal effects on seed weight were much larger than paternal effects, and seed weight was also strongly influenced by resource availability (especially nitrogen). The highest seed weights were usually found when genets were associated with Astragalus frigidus, which seems to be the optimal host species in the population, but similar results were achieved with NPK (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) fertilization. Defoliation experiments revealed an innate minimum seed weight, below which seed number was affected by resource deprivation. The reciprocal crossing program indicated a high level of gender specialization in individual genets (clones), ranging continuously from almost pure males to almost pure females. Early-flowering genets showed the highest average male RS, whereas female RS increased in late-flowering genets. Phenological separation of the genets into 'early' and 'late' revealed an inverse correlation between male and female performance. Numerous characters contributing to phenotypic gender were measured in the genets, but these characters and functional gender calculations from the diallel experiment were only weakly correlated. It is concluded that simultaneous measures of both male and female RS are needed for a reliable assessment of gender variation.",,,"MOLAU, U (corresponding author), UNIV GOTEBORG,DEPT SYSTEMAT BOT,CARL SKOTTSBERGS GATA 22,S-41319 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN.",,,"Molau, Ulf/0000-0002-6089-6879",,,,,56,32,32,0,11,BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC,COLUMBUS,"OHIO STATE UNIV-DEPT BOTANY 1735 NEIL AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210",0002-9122,,,AM J BOT,Am.

In the present study, the methanol extract of the whole plant was examined for diuretic activity in rats. The activity was evaluated using parameters such as urine volume after 5, 19, and 24 h and urine sodium, potassium, and chloride concentrations. The extract was further scrutinized for polyphenolic compounds and triterpenoids. The extract demonstrated a significant increase in and dose-dependent effect on urine excretion volume in comparison to the normal group in the tested range of 100-400 mg/kg. The extract demonstrated comparable saluretic and higher natriuretic activity (Na<SU+</SU/K<SU+</SU) compared to the furosemide treated group. However, the Cl<SU-</SU/Na<SU+</SU + K<SU+</SU ratio, which indicates carbonic anhydrase mediated activity, remained unaffected. HPLC and quantitative analysis of the extract revealed that polyphenolic compounds and the triterpenoid, oleanolic acid, are the major phytochemicals, and are proposed to be responsible for the observed diuretic effect. Oleanolic acid has been reported to possess diuretic activity with significant potassium loss in rats. In contrast to pure oleanolic acid, the extract demonstrated a valuable potassium-sparing effect. This suggests modulation of the diuretic effect of oleanolic acid by polyphenolics present in the extract. The observed dose-dependent potassium-sparing diuretic effect is a hereto unreported property of this plant.</.","[Jadhav, R. B.; Surana, S.

Dwarf mistletoe infection results in physiological changes in the host, eventually causing the death of the host tree. In this study, we evaluated the changes in leaf reflectance of spruce trees, Picea crassifolia, infected by DM (Arceuthobium sichuanense) with ground-based hyperspectral technology. A total of 112 sample sites were selected for analysis in the eastern part of Qinghai Province, China, including healthy spruce tree, light DM-infected spruce tree, moderate DM-infected spruce tree and high DM-infected spruce tree in each site. The results showed that leaf reflectance was significantly different among healthy spruce, DM-infected spruce, DM and dead spruce in the near-infrared regions ranging from similar to 750 to 900 nm. Dwarf mistletoe infection resulted in the increase of leaf reflectance of host tree, and the intensity of DM infection was positively related to reflectance. However, five selected hyperspectral indices that commonly used to estimate the physiological status of plants (carotenoid reflectance index, photochemical reflectance index, normalized difference vegetation index, structure-insensitive pigment index and water index) were not linearly correlated with the intensity of DM infection. Collectively, the hyperspectral characteristics of spruce infected by DM can be potentially used to detect DM-induced changes on a landscape scale with satellite remote sensing, which can be used as an efficient advanced tool for DM disease monitoring.","[Xiong, Dianguang; Tian, Chengming] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Huang, Huayi] Guangdong Acad Forestry, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Silviculture Protect & Uti, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zezhong] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhouyuan] Beijing Forestry Univ, China Grassland Res Ctr, Sch Grassland Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University; Peking University; Beijing Forestry University,"Tian, CM (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",chengmt@bjfu.edu.cn,"wang, zezhong/AAW-4958-2021; Li, Joey Zhouyuan/H-4226-2011","wang, zezhong/0000-0002-5778-3769; Li, Joey Zhouyuan/0000-0003-2830-4076",National Key Research and Development Program [2017YFD0600105],National Key Research and Development Program,"We appreciate the great help from Beishan National Forest Park, Maixiu National Forest Park and Xianmi National Forest Park in Qinghai Province, China.

Consumers usually belong to different trophic guilds, from folivores and sapsuckers to parasitic plants. We propose that mistletoes parasitizing pines could play a key role acting as herbivores on host pines and coming indirectly into competition with other herbivores feeding on the same host. Changes caused by mistletoes on its host have been well studied, but its effects running across trophic webs remain unrevealed. In this study, we investigate the effect of European mistletoe (Viscum album subsp. austriacum) on the host-feeding herbivores via trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) across their shared pine host (Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii). We performed field and laboratory experiments, and analyzed the net effect of different mistletoe parasite loads on three host-phytophagous species: the sapsucker Cinara pini (Aphididae), the winter folivore Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Thaumetopoeidae), and the summer folivore Brachyderes sp. (Curculionidae), all being members of different functional feeding groups (FFGs). We summarize the mistletoe-host-herbivore interactions by means of a TMII, where mistletoe parasitism causes non-trophic links and detrimental indirect interactions on pine-feeding herbivores across its shared host, suggesting a worsening of host quality as food. These indirect interactions vary according to three parameters. First, the intensity has a non-proportional relation with parasite load, showing an impact threshold on highly parasitized pines. Second, the movement capacity of insect herbivores determines their response, by decreasing the abundance of herbivores with low movement ability (aphids and pine processionary caterpillars) while altering the behavior (plant selection) of more mobile herbivores (pine weevils). Finally, FFG determines the intensity of mistletoe parasitism effects, folivores being more responsive than sapsuckers. Overall, mistletoe generates non-trophic interaction linkages in the forest able to modify community structure by becoming a nexus of the entire herbivore community of the pine canopy.","[Lazaro-Gonzalez, Alba; Hodar, Jose A.; Zamora, Regino] Univ Granada, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Dept Ecol, Fac Sci, Av Fuentenueva S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Lazaro-Gonzalez, A (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Dept Ecol, Fac Sci, Av Fuentenueva S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",albalazaro@ugr.es,"Hódar, José A/G-3447-2018; Lázaro-González, Alba/H-9170-2018; Zamora, Regino/B-3179-2010","Hódar, José A/0000-0003-3475-4997; Lázaro-González, Alba/0000-0002-3367-180X; Zamora, Regino/0000-0002-5049-9968",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CLAVINOVA CGL2011-29910]; FPI predoctoral grant from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2012-057125],"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); FPI predoctoral grant from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness","We are especially grateful to the Andalusian Environmental Council, Junta de Andalucia, and the Direction of the Sierra de Baza Natural Park, for providing permission for field work, Ramon Ruiz-Puche helped us while field sampling and laboratory sample processing, and David Nesbitt looked over the English version of the manuscript.

We show that the previously described sclerenchymatous 'horn' or 'prong' formed within the haustorium acts as a sickle-like cutting device which transversely severs the host root and then becomes lodged in haustorial collar tissue directly opposite to that where it originated. The cutting process is deduced to be rapid and the gland-like fluid filled structure in the haustorium is suggested to generate a hydrostatic force driving the device through the host root. The haustorial parenchyma cells at the tight junction between the endophytic part of the haustorium and the cut face of the host root develop balloon-like outgrowths which intrude into the lumina of severed xylem vessels of the host. Experiments feeding 0.05% (w/v) basic fuchsin to freshly cut ends of host root segments distal to terminally-attached mature haustoria demonstrate an apoplastic pathway from host xylem elements fractured at the interface into haustorial parenchyma, and thence through vascular tissue to the haustorium into the transpiring plant of Nuytsia. Application of labelled water (D2O) to uncut basal roots of petted plants of Acacia acuminata parasitized by Nuytsia results in labelling of leafy shoots of parasite and host, indicative of haustorial uptake of water by Nuytsia from host root xylem in the intact association. Measurements of xylem water potentials of pot-cultured seedling Nuytsia associated with a range of hosts, or of mature trees of Nuytsia and partner woody hosts in the native habitat, demonstrate consistently more negative potentials in the parasite than host, suggesting that the parasite may regularly obtain xylem water through its haustorial apparatus.

The presence of both white and bright purple flowers on the same plant in the New Zealand alpine annual creeping eyebright (Euphrasia dyeriWettst.) provides an ideal opportunity to investigate the significance of flower colour in an environment where coloured flowers are rare. The relationships among flower age, gender phase, reward availability and petal colour were assessed in natural populations of E.dyeri. The effect of pollination on flower colour was tested using hand pollination of bagged flowers. Direct observations and videos of flowers were used to assess patterns of flower visitation by native and introduced pollinators. Unpollinated white E.dyeri flowers changed from white to purple within 6 days. However, pollination of white flowers triggered a significantly faster colour change, typically within 1-2 days. White flowers had receptive stigmas, large amounts of lipid-rich pollen and small amounts of nectar, whereas stigmas of purple flowers are not receptive and flowers did not provide pollen or nectar rewards. Flowers were mainly visited by native syrphid flies. Both native syrphids and introduced Bombus bees showed a marked avoidance of purple flowers, tending to preferentially visit white flowers. Our study suggests that flower colour change from white to bright purple in E.dyeri functions to direct pollinators to rewarding, receptive flowers. As many EuphrasiaL. species are described as having variably coloured flowers, this mechanism may be more widespread in the genus. Furthermore, our results add to the growing evidence that the dominance of white flowers in the New Zealand alpine is not simply due to a lack of colour discrimination among pollinators.","[McGimpsey, Vicky J.; Lord, Janice M.] Univ Otago, Dept Bot, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Lord, JM (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Bot, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",janice.lord@otago.ac.nz,"Lord, Janice Marjorie/A-8869-2012; Waymouth, Vicky J/ABG-2895-2021","Lord, Janice Marjorie/0000-0001-8314-0428; Waymouth, Vicky J/0000-0001-9347-9804",Otago University,Otago University,"We thank Dana Dudle, Olivia Sawrey, Thomas Waymouth, Jo-anne McGimpsey, Lorna Little, Lars Ludwig, Ella Hayman, Janine Wing, Stewart Bell, Vickey Tomlinson, Rebecca Macdonald, Susan MacKenzie, Trish Fleming, Mary Anne Miller and John Steel for assistance; Otago University publishing bursary for financial support; Department of Conservation for permission to work in conservation areas.

Mistletoe Passovia ovata parasitizing evergreen (Miconia albicans) hosts and P. ovata parasitizing deciduous (Byrsonima verbascifolia) hosts were sampled in a Neotropical savanna. Photosynthetic parameters, diurnal cycles of stomatal conductance, pre-dawn and midday leaf water potential, and stomatal anatomical traits were measured during the peak of the dry and wet seasons, respectively. P. ovata showed distinct water-use strategies that were dependent on host phenology. For P. ovata parasitizing the deciduous host, water use efficiency (WUE; ratio of photosynthetic rate to transpirational water loss) was 2-fold lower in the dry season than in the wet season; in contrast, WUE was maintained at the same level during the wet and dry seasons in P. ovata parasitizing the evergreen host. Generally, mistletoe and host diurnal cycles of stomatal conductance were linked, although there were clear differences in leaf water potential, with mistletoe showing anisohydric behaviour and the host showing isohydric behaviour. Compared to mistletoes attached to evergreen hosts, those parasitizing deciduous hosts had a 1.4-fold lower stomatal density and 1.2-fold wider stomata on both leaf surfaces, suggesting that the latter suffered less intense drought stress. This is the first study to show morphophysiological differences in the same mistletoe species parasitizing hosts of different phenological groups. Our results provide evidence that phenotypical plasticity (anatomical and physiological) might be essential to favour the use of a greater range of hosts.","[Scalon, Marina Correa; Franco, Augusto Cesar] Univ Brasilia, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Bot, Lab Ecofisiol Vegetal, Caixa Postal 04457, BR-70904970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Rossatto, Davi Rodrigo] Univ Estadual Paulista UNESP, Dept Biol FCAV, Lab Ecol Vegetal, UNESP Campus Jaboticabal, BR-14884000 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil; [Chaves Bicalho Domingos, Fabricius Maia] Univ Brasilia, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Zool, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade de Brasilia,"Scalon, MC (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Bot, Lab Ecofisiol Vegetal, Caixa Postal 04457, BR-70904970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",marina_scalon@yahoo.com.br,"Franco, Augusto C/B-1615-2008; Scalon, Marina C/D-3598-2016; Domingos, Fabricius/D-7004-2019; Rossatto, Davi Rodrigo/A-3521-2011","Franco, Augusto C/0000-0003-0869-5989; Scalon, Marina C/0000-0003-2069-8226; Domingos, Fabricius/0000-0003-2069-9317; Rossatto, Davi Rodrigo/0000-0001-9510-8345",CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico); CNPq [303637/2011-0]; Universal-CNPq research Grant [484545/2012-4],CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Universal-CNPq research Grant,MCS is supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico).

Penn. (Scrophulariaceae) is a self-incompatible annual distributed from central Texas south into northern Mexico. In central Texas, flowering can begin in mid-July and continue through mid-October. Pollinators are Bombus pennsylvanicus and Apis mellifera. Previous field experiments have shown that two populations differ in seed production from single bee visit experiments (Wellhouse population with a high seed production and Firefly Meadow population with a low seed production). An isozyme study was undertaken to discern whether any differences in genetic structure existed between the two populations that might be associated with the difference in seed production. Populations of A. strictifolia maintain high levels of genetic diversity with values ranging from 0.200 to 0.233. Values of F(ST) showed significant genetic structure among subpopulations at the Wellhouse (WH) population but not at Firefly Meadow (FM). Most of the variation occurred between subpopulations rather than between populations. Inbreeding coefficients (F(IS)) and outcrossing rates (t) differed only slightly between populations and suggested that both were primarily outcrossing. Estimated migration rates (Nm) based on F(ST) values differed greatly between populations with FM having a migration rate that was 4.6 x greater than at WH. At FM, annual variability in density and a requirement for multiple bee visits for full seed production may account for the high migration rate. The Mantel's Z test for correlation between matrices of Rogers' genetic similarity and interplant distance was significant for both populations. The relationship was negative as expected at the WH population but positive at FM. A positive relationship between these has not been previously reported. Despite the genetic differences detected, no clear distinction was noted that could easily be connected with the previously observed difference in seed production from single bee visits.","INST ECOL,91000 XALAPA,VERACRUZ,MEXICO; TEXAS TECH UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,LUBBOCK,TX 79409",Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,,,"Dieringer, Gregg/J-3882-2019","Dieringer, Gregg/0000-0002-2669-1204",,,,,29,6,6,0,5,TORREY BOTANICAL CLUB,BRONX,"NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN, BRONX, NY 10458",0040-9618,,,B TORREY BOT CLUB,Bull.

Hybridization occurs between the annual hemiparasites Rhinanthus minor and Rhinanthus angustifolius (Orobanchaceae). Using flower morphology, Kwak (1980) found a prevalence of hybrids close to R. angustifolius in a single population. We aim to find whether this pattern is also found using genetic markers, whether it is generally occurring in mixed populations, and whether these populations are stable over time. We used species-specific genetic markers to determine the number of individuals in a range of hybrid classes in three mixed populations of different ages during four consecutive years. In the young population, F-1 hybrids were found in the first year and mostly hybrids between R. minor and these F(1)s in the second year, but in the years after that, hybrids close to R. angustifolius became more abundant. We also found this in the two older populations, where hybrids close to R. angustifolius always occurred in higher frequencies than hybrids close to R. minor. Over time, R. angustifolius strongly increased in frequency in two populations. Patterns of marker presence and absence suggested that advanced-generation hybrids are mainly formed by backcrossing with one of the parents, predominantly R. angustifolius whenever its frequency in the population is higher than 15%. The dynamics of mixed populations depend on the ecological conditions that regulate the presence of the two parental species, and introgression into R. angustifolius seems prevalent.","[Ducarme, Veronique; Vrancken, Jerome; Wesselingh, Renate A.] Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Biodivers Res Ctr, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",,"Wesselingh, RA (corresponding author), Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Biodivers Res Ctr, Croix Sud 4-5, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",renate.wesselingh@uclouvain.be,"Wesselingh, Renate A./F-4240-2011","Wesselingh, Renate A./0000-0003-0241-2255",Belgian National Fund for Research [FRFC 2.4573.02]; Fonds Speciaux de Recherche of Louvain University,Belgian National Fund for Research(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); Fonds Speciaux de Recherche of Louvain University,"We thank Linda Dhondt and Christine Noel for their technical assistance in the laboratory, the site managers Jean Vermander of the experimental garden Jardin Massart, Martin Swannet of Kijkverdriet and Kristin Van de Velde of Kalkense Meersen for permission to sample and the Belgian National Fund for Research (FRFC 2.4573.02) and the Fonds Speciaux de Recherche of Louvain University for financial support.

However, no study has explicitly examined local adaptation of co-occurring parasitic and autotrophic plant species to the abiotic environment. Here we test the hypotheses that a generalist parasitic tree would display a weaker signal of selection and that genomic variation would associate with fewer climatic variables (particularly precipitation) but have similar spatial patterns to a sympatric autotrophic tree species. To test these hypotheses, we collected samples from 17 sites across the range of two tree species, the hemiparasiteNuytsia floribunda(n = 264) and sympatric autotrophMelaleuca rhaphiophylla(n = 272). We obtained 5,531 high-quality genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) forM. rhaphiophyllaand 6,727 SNPs forN. floribundausing DArTseq genome scan technology. Population differentiation and environmental association approaches were used to identify signals of selection. Generalized dissimilarly modelling was used to detect climatic and spatial patterns of local adaptation across climatic gradients. Overall, 322 SNPs were identified as putatively adaptive for the autotroph, while only 57 SNPs were identified for the parasitic species. We found genomic variation to associate with different sets of bioclimatic variables for each species, with precipitation relatively less important for the parasite. Spatial patterns of predicted adaptive variability were different and indicate that co-occurring species with disparate life history traits may not respond equally to selective pressures (i.e., temperature and precipitation). Together, these findings provide insight into local adaptation of sympatric parasitic and autotrophic tree species to abiotic environments.","[Walters, Sheree J.; Wardell-Johnson, Grant W.; Nevill, Paul] Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, ARC Ctr Mine Site Restorat, Perth, WA, Australia; [Robinson, Todd P.] Curtin Univ, Sch Earth & Planetary Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Byrne, Margaret] Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Byrne, Margaret] Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Nevill, Paul] Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, Trace & Environm DNA Lab, Perth, WA, Australia",Curtin University; Curtin University; Curtin University; Curtin University,"Walters, SJ (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, ARC Ctr Mine Site Restorat, GPO Box U1987, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia.",sheree.walters@postgrad.curtin.edu.au,"Robinson, Todd/G-9400-2013; Byrne, Margaret/H-8198-2015","Robinson, Todd/0000-0003-3314-3748; Wardell-Johnson, Grant/0000-0002-6751-9224; Byrne, Margaret/0000-0002-7197-5409; Nevill, Paul/0000-0001-8238-0534; Walters, Sheree/0000-0001-6295-8853",Australian Research Council [ICI150100041],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: ICI150100041",,97,8,8,5,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Many primates exhibit behavioral and dietary flexibility to cope with these changing environments. Titi monkeys (family Pitheciidae, subfamily Callicebinae) are small-bodied, diurnal platyrrhines inhabiting a wide range of altitudinal and habitat types. Researchers have noted considerable variation in their dietary and feeding ecology; however, it is unclear what role dietary flexibility plays in various habitat types. Here, I present the first data on the feeding and foraging ecology of Plecturocebus oenanthe, a Critically Endangered species, inhabiting a secondary forest in Peru. I examined diet composition, food part selection, food species diversity, and seasonal variation in diet composition and feeding behavior, in relation to relative availability of resources. Overall, the titis consumed mostly fruits (54%), followed by insects (22%), nonreproductive plant parts (17%), flowers (4%), and seeds (1.3%). The titis relied on very few plant species per month and overall. They consumed more insects and flowers during the dry season and more fruit during the wet season, corresponding to higher fruit availability. During the dry season, the titis decreased time spent feeding on fruit, but increased or maintained the number of plant species utilized. The titis were also able to subsist on resources common to secondary habitats or altered habitats, including liana species, hemiparasitic mistletoes, cultivated species, and pioneer species. Understanding the potential dietary flexibility for this species will help researchers to predict the most suitable habitats and floristic composition for this species to develop appropriate conservation management strategies.","[DeLuycker, Anneke M.] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Smithsonian Mason Sch Conservat, 1500 Remt Rd, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA",Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute,"DeLuycker, AM (corresponding author), Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Smithsonian Mason Sch Conservat, 1500 Remt Rd, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA.",adeluyck@gmu.edu,"DeLuycker, Anneke/ADP-9293-2022","DeLuycker, Anneke/0000-0002-9767-9210",,,,,80,1,1,2,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0164-0291,1573-8604,,INT J PRIMATOL,Int.

Although DNA metabarcoding of scats and coprolites (palaeofaeces) can identify the past and present species interactions of their depositors, the usefulness of coprolites in conservation biology is untested as few endangered taxa have known coprolite records. Here, we perform multilocus metabarcoding sequencing and palynological analysis of dietary plants of >100 coprolites (estimated to date from c. 400-1900 A.D.) and > 100 frozen scats (dating c. 1950 A.D. to present) of the critically endangered, flightless, herbivorous kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), a species that disappeared from its natural range in Aotearoa-New Zealand (NZ) after the 13th C. A.D. We identify 24 orders, 56 families and 67 native plant genera unrecorded in modern kakapo diets (increases of 69, 108 and 75% respectively). We found that southern beeches (Nothofagaceae), which are important canopy-forming trees and not an important kakapo food today, dominated kakapo diets in upland (c. >900 m elevation) habitats. We also found that kakapo frequently consumed hemiparasitic mistletoes (Loranthaceae) and the holoparasitic wood rose (Dactylanthus taylorii), taxa which are nutrient rich, and now threatened by mammalian herbivory and a paucity of dispersers and pollinators. No single dataset or gene identified all taxa in our dataset, demonstrating the value of multiproxy or multigene datasets in studies of animal diets. Our results highlight how contemporary data may considerably underestimate the full dietary breadth of threatened species and demonstrate the potential value of coprolite analysis in conservation biology.","[Boast, Alexander P.; Perry, George L.

In this study, we examined the genetic structure and host-parasite interaction of a strain of S. gesnerioides parasitizing L hirsuta (SGFL) from central Florida (United States). Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to compare genetic profiles from 71 individual S. gesnerioides plants (SGFL) representing four different populations in central Florida. Our results showed that these individuals are genetically similar, with pairwise genetic distances ranging from 0.00 to 0.037. A cluster analysis grouped all four S. gesnerioides populations from Florida, separating them from S. gesnerioides isolates parasitic on L hirsuta and cowpea collected from West Africa. One EcoRI and MseI selective primer combination generated a 510-bp fragment present in individuals from the SGFL and the West African isolate parasitic on I. hirsuta, but absent in isolates parasitic on cowpea. Germination of seed from individuals of all four populations of S. gesnerioides parasitic on I. hirsuta from Florida was stimulated by root exudates from cowpea genotypes Blackeye and TVX-3236, known to be highly susceptible to all races of S. gesnerioides parasitic on cowpea in West Africa. SGFL seedlings failed to parasitize cowpea, with the development of attached SGFL seedlings arrested at the tubercle stage. The very high level of genetic uniformity observed within and among the central Florida populations suggests that there was likely a single introduction of the parasite or strong host-driven selection to genetic uniformity. These findings are important in assessing the potential of the parasite as an agronomically significant pest in the United States.","Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Virginia,"Timko, MP (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Gilmer Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",mpt9g@virginia.edu,,,,,,,44,28,29,1,12,AMER PHYTOPATHOLOGICAL SOC,ST PAUL,"3340 PILOT KNOB ROAD, ST PAUL, MN 55121 USA",0031-949X,1943-7684,,PHYTOPATHOLOGY,Phytopathology,OCT,2005,95,10,,,,,1166,1173,,10.1094/PHYTO-95-1166,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-95-1166,,,8,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,969PB,18943469,hybrid,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000232245400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is known for its aromatic heartwood oil, which is used in incense and perfume. Demand for sandalwood-based products has led to drastic over-harvesting, and wild Santalum populations are now threatened. Knowledge of phylogenetic relationships will be critical for the conservation and proper management of this genus. Here, we sequenced the chloroplast genome of 11 Santalum species. The data were then used to investigate chloroplast genome evolutionary dynamics and relationships and divergence time within Santalum and related species. The Santalum chloroplast genome contains typical quadripartite structures, ranging from 143,291 to 144,263 bp. The chloroplast genome contains 110 unique genes. The whole set of ndh genes and the infA gene were found to lose their functions. The P-distance among the Santalum species was 0.0003 to 0.00828. Three mutation hotspot regions, 14 small inversions, and 460 indels events were discovered in the Santalum chloroplast genome. Branch-model-based selection analyses showed that the Santalum species were under widespread purifying selection. Our phylogenomic assessment provides an improved resolution to the phylogenetic relationships of Santalum compared to the past analyses. Our divergence time analysis showed that the crown age of Santalum was 8.46 Mya (million years ago), the first divergence occurred around 6.97 Mya, and diversification was completed approximately 1 Mya. By sequencing the 11 Santalum species chloroplast genomes, we identified the variations in the Santalum chloroplast genomes. Using the chloroplast genome sequences, phylogeny and divergence time analyses discovered that the Santalum species were likely to originate due to radiation evolution, and most speciation events occurred less than 1 Mya.","[Liu, Xiaojin; Xu, Daping; Hong, Zhou; Zhang, Ningnan; Cui, Zhiyi] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Trop Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Tropical Forestry, CAF","Xu, DP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Trop Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, Peoples R China.",xjliu@caf.ac.cn; gzfsrd@163.com; hzhou1981@sina.com; ningnanzhang@126.com; czy@caf.ac.cn,"Cui, Zhiyi/HCH-4650-2022","Liu, Xiaojin/0000-0001-9677-6388; hong, zhou/0000-0001-9955-9469","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Non-profit Research Institution of Chinese Academy of Forestry [CAFYBB2019QB003, CAFYBB2016QB010]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31500512]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD060060503]",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Non-profit Research Institution of Chinese Academy of Forestry; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"FundingThis research was funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Non-profit Research Institution of Chinese Academy of Forestry, grant number CAFYBB2019QB003, CAFYBB2016QB010, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 31500512) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China, grant number 2016YFD060060503.",,87,2,2,8,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,OCT,2021,12,10,,,,,,,1303,10.3390/f12101303,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f12101303,,,18,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,WN9KF,,gold,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000712083500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We highlight the research and implementation gaps and discuss possible newer biotechnological interventions to be made in relation to biological control agents and mistletoe-resistant tree cultivars. We also discuss the potential of smart technological alternatives that find synergies with conventional approaches. Mistletoes have been considered a keystone resource for biodiversity, as well as a remarkable source of medicinal attributes that attract pharmacologists. Due to their hemiparasitic nature, mistletoes leach water and nutrients, including primary and secondary metabolites, through the vascular systems of their plant hosts, primarily trees. As a result of intense mistletoe infection, the hosts suffer various growth and physiological detriments, which often lead to tree mortality. Because of their easy dispersal and widespread tropism, mistletoes have become serious pests for commercial fruit and timber plantations. A variety of physical and chemical treatment methods, along with silvicultural practices, have shaped conventional mistletoe management. Others, however, have either failed to circumvent the growing range and tropism of these parasitic plants or present significant environmental and public health risks. A biocontrol approach that could sidestep these issues has never achieved full proof of concept in real-field applications. Our review discusses the downsides of conventional mistletoe control techniques and explores the possibilities of biotechnological approaches using biocontrol agents and transgenic technologies. It is possible that smart management options will pave the way for technologically advanced solutions to mitigate mistletoes that are yet to be exploited.","[Mudgal, Gaurav; Kaur, Jaspreet; Chand, Kartar; Parashar, Manisha; Dhar, Sanjoy K.; Singh, Gajendra B.] Chandigarh Univ, Univ Inst Biotechnol, Mohali 140413, Punjab, India; [Gururani, Mayank A.] U Arab Emirates Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biol, Al Ain 15551, U Arab Emirates",Chandigarh University; United Arab Emirates University,"Mudgal, G (corresponding author), Chandigarh Univ, Univ Inst Biotechnol, Mohali 140413, Punjab, India.;Gururani, MA (corresponding author), U Arab Emirates Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biol, Al Ain 15551, U Arab Emirates.",gauravmdgl@gmail.com; gaurav.mudgal@cumail.in,"MUDGAL, GAURAV/HIZ-8445-2022","MUDGAL, GAURAV/0000-0003-4303-4983; Gururani, Mayank/0000-0003-4254-6450","College of Science, United Arab Emirates University, UAE","College of Science, United Arab Emirates University, UAE","The authors acknowledge the financial support for the publication of this article, received from the College of Science, United Arab Emirates University, UAE.",,415,1,1,13,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-7737,,BIOLOGY-BASEL,Biology-Basel,NOV,2022,11,11,,,,,,,1645,10.3390/biology11111645,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology11111645,,,35,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,6A8OT,36358346,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-05-23,WOS:000880908600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An analysis of phylogeographic population structure and demography and Bayesian inference methods were conducted on P. mayanus from 16 localities across the range of the species. To assess the historical processes and changes through the Pleistocene climatic cycles that may have affected the distribution and demographic history of the species, the current potential distribution of the species was modelled using ecological niche modelling (ENM) and projected onto the mid Holocene (MH), Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Last Inter Glacial (LIG). Psittacanthus mayanus exhibited higher haplotype and nucleotide diversity in the southern part of its distribution than in the northern part. Two divergent lineages were revealed in the phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses of ribotypes and haplotypes. Populations from the northern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula probably experienced a recent population growth, whereas populations from the southern portion of the Peninsula and Chiapas are marked by historical demographic stability and isolation. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) analyses strongly supported a scenario of post-glacial population growth. ENM results indicate that the distribution of P. mayanus expanded and was connected into the southern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula during LGM conditions and colonized the northern portion of the Peninsula and fragmented during MH conditions. According to the ABC and ENM results, the genetic differentiation of P. mayanus may be linked to the effects of the glacial/interglacial cycles and environmental factors, in which populations of P. mayanus expanded during the LGM into the Pet,n province currently covered with semideciduous tropical rain forest followed by northward expansion, southwards contractions and post-glacial colonization of the northernmost portion of the Yucatan province, a region currently covered with seasonally dry tropical deciduous forest. Our results highlight the influence of Pleistocene events in shaping the geographical distribution of genetic variation in Neotropical lowland forest. The phylogeographic and environmental patterns in P. mayanus provide an opportunity to investigate further the evolution of Mexican lowland forest biodiversity.","[Licona-Vera, Yuyini; Ortiz-Rodriguez, Andres E.; Acini Vasquez-Aguilar, Antonio; Francisco Ornelas, Juan] Inst Ecol AC, Dept Biol Evolut, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico",Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico,"Ornelas, JF (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC, Dept Biol Evolut, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico.",francisco.ornelas@inecol.mx,"Ornelas, Juan Francisco/A-2250-2014","Ornelas, Juan Francisco/0000-0002-1124-1163; Vasquez-Aguilar, Antonio Acini/0000-0002-4920-7278; Licona-Vera, Yuyini/0000-0001-6616-361X","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [155686]; Departamento de Biologia Evolutiva, Instituto de Ecologia, A.

Our goal was to evaluate transdermal water loss, parasite-host mineral relationships, and heterotrophy in the holoparasitic genus Hydnora. We estimated in situ transdermal water loss in Hydnora and measured nutrient profiles and delta(13)C and delta(15)N signatures for Hydnora and hosts in southern Africa and Madagascar. For comparison we also measured delta(13)C and delta(15)N for aerial hemiparasites at the same sites. Transdermal water loss in Hydnora ranged from 0.14 +/- 0.02 to 0.38 +/- 0.04 mg cm(-2) h(-1) and was comparable to transpiration rates for water conservative xerophytes. Concentrations of P and K were higher in Hydnora relative to CAM hosts; other mineral concentrations were significantly lower in the parasite or were not different. delta(13)C signatures of holoparasites and hemiparasites relative to their hosts reflected host metabolism and differences in commitment to heterotrophic C gain. Holoparasite delta(13)C values were significantly enriched (by 0.55 parts per thousand +/- 0.23) compared to host shoot and depleted compared to host root tissues (by 0.97 parts per thousand +/- 0.12). Holoparasite delta(13)C values were not significantly different compared to the estimated whole host delta(13)C value. delta(15)N values for holoparasites and hemiparasites were significantly correlated with hosts. The water conservative nature of Hydnora spp. combined with parasite-host mineral nutrition profiles are suggestive of active processes of solute uptake. Stable isotope fractionation in host tissues dictated significant differences between parasite and host (shoot and root) delta(13)C signatures. The confirmation of complete heterotrophy and the lack of a confounding transpiration stream may make Hydnora a promising model organism for the examination of parasite solute uptake.

Mean seed mass varied two-fold among plants between the ages of 4 and 14 years old and was positively correlated with parental plant age. Both the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation in mean seed mass decreased with increasing plant age demonstrating that, on average, younger plants produced seed with more variable mass. Nitrogen concentrations (mg nitrogen per gram of seed) of both the seed and fruit (pericarp) were not correlated with mass or the age of the parent plant from which the seed was taken. However, the nitrogen content per seed (mg nitrogen per seed) was positively correlated with the mean seed dry mass and the age of the seed parent, suggesting that the carbon to nitrogen ratio of individual seeds remained relatively constant as seed mass increased and plants grew older. Seed germination ranged between 20% and 86% and was positively correlated with mass and parental plant age. Heavier seeds (seeds from older plants) also had the highest root radicle growth rates. Furthermore, the final root radicle length after 76 d of growth was positively correlated with seed dry mass. When grown on a medium containing an extract prepared from the host plant foliage, all seeds showed lower germination, grew more slowly and had shorter overall root radicles, but had significantly greater development of the haustorial disks (the holdfast which forms the host-parasite junction in Phoradendron) than seeds grown on a control medium. Our results suggest that, on average, seeds of greater mass produced by older plants have a greater total resource pool per propagule (fruit+seed). This resource pool may be important in conferring a greater potential for dispersal (fruit), survival, colonization, and establishment.","UNIV UTAH,DEPT BIOL,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84112",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,,,"Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010",,,,,,62,23,23,0,14,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,85,3,,,,,332,342,,10.1007/BF00320608,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00320608,,,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ER799,28312037,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:A1991ER79900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many of the mistletoes are reported to be medicinally important. The hemiparasitic nature of these plants makes their chemical composition dependent on the host on which it grows. They are shown to exhibit morphological dissimilarities also when growing on different hosts. Helicanthus elastica (Desr.) Danser (mango mistletoe) is one such less explored medicinal mistletoe found on almost every mango tree in India. Traditionally, the leaves of this plant are used for checking abortion and for removing stones in the kidney and urinary bladder while significant antioxidant and antimicrobial properties are also attributed to this species of mistletoe. The current study was undertaken to evaluate molecular differences in the genomic DNA of the plant while growing on five different host trees using four random markers employing random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) followed by similarity matrix by Jaccard's coefficient and distance matrix by hierarchal clustering analysis. Similarity and distance matrix data employing just 4 random markers, separately and the pooled data as well, revealed significant difference in the genomic DNA of H. elastica growing on five different hosts. Pooled data of similarity from all the 4 primers cumulatively showed similarity between 0.256 and 0.311. Distance matrix ranged from of 0.256 to 0.281 on pooling the data from all the four primers. The result employing a minimum number of primers could conclude that genomic DNA of H. elastica differs depending upon the host on which it grows, hence the host must be considered while studying or utilizing this mistletoe for medicinal purposes.

Translocation of resources is, however, not restricted to clonal plants, but can also occur between shoots of genetically different individuals. We analysed ''non-clonal'' integration between individuals of the facultative root hemiparasite Rhinanthus serotinus that reciprocally parasitized each other. The parasites were grown pairwise in pots without hosts. In half of the pots the parasites were separated below ground by a plastic division. In the other half of the pots the plants developed connections through haustoria. In a first experiment the separation treatment was combined with different levels of soil nutrients. The mean performance of the two plants in a pot was not influenced by separation, but increased considerably with increasing soil nutrient levels. The size variation between plants in a pot was much higher if plants were connected below ground. Because the environment within pots was homogeneous, this must be interpreted as asymmetric competition for belowground resources. However, the level of these resources did not significantly affect the size variation and therefore the strength of competition. In a second experiment a heterogeneous environment was simulated by applying fertilizer to the leaves of one parasite per pot. Under these conditions size variation between plants within a pot was significantly lower if the parasites were connected below ground than if they were not. This indicates that resource translocation similar to that observed in clonal plants can occur between genetically different hemiparasites. Since non-clonal systems can at least partly mimic phenomena found in clonal systems, adaptive explanations for clonal integration have to be applied with caution.",,,"Prati, D (corresponding author), UNIV ZURICH, INST UMWELTWISSENSCH, WINTERTHURERSTR 190, CH-8057 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.",,"Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Matthies, Diethart/0000-0003-2439-0501",,,,,50,15,15,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,1997,78,2,,,,,221,229,,10.2307/3546288,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3546288,,,9,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WJ769,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:A1997WJ76900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

About 40% only flower up to 2 years after fire (obligate), while the rest continue at a low rate until the next fire (facultative). Peak flowering occurs 5-18 months after fire in the mediterranean regions but at 1-7 months in savannas. Fsf is recorded in 34 families, headed by terrestrial orchids (45% of species), spread throughout the seed-plant phylogeny from cycads to daisies. Tuberous geophytes (essentially orchids) dominate (51%), but other resprouting growth forms include lignotuberous shrubs and forbs, rhizomatous and bunch grasses, leaf succulents, grasstrees, epicormic trees, and hemiparasites. Most have wind-dispersed diaspores (72%), store their diaspores in the soil (93%), and seeds that do not germinate until the next fire (72%). Fsf in association with resprouting takes advantage of optimal resources and minimal competition for growth and reproduction, conditions that favor wind dispersal and maximize the interval for seed accumulation before the next fire and build-up of fire-tolerant organs. Reduced herbivory has little role in accounting for its benefits. The proximal causes of fsf center around cueing factors (direct effects such as ethylene), resource factors (direct and indirect effects, e.g., extra nutrients), and predisposing factors (circumstantial effects, e.g., fire interval).

They can be categorized into root parasites and stem parasites in terms of parasitic sites or divided into hemiparasites and holoparasites according to the degree of nutritional dependence on their hosts via haustoria. However, little is known concerning distribution patterns of different parasitic plant types and their determinants, which may be helpful for effective management and ecological conservation. Here, we collated an updated checklist of parasitic angiosperms in China and examined the distribution pattern of the four types, and then performed multiple linear regression analysis and redundancy analysis of 22 influencing factors representing biotic, topographic, and climatic factors. There are 745 species of parasitic angiosperms in China, belonging to 50 genera and 12 families. Regarding root parasites, most appeared in the west of China than in the east; while stem parasites showed a broader north-south divide in distribution. Hemiparasites were fewer in the east and more in the southwest. However, holoparasites displayed a patchy distribution across China. The results of redundancy analysis (after eliminating multicollinearity effects) showed that explained variation of root parasites, stem parasites, and hemiparasites was 87.9%, 93.7%, and 87.0%, respectively; while that of holoparasites was only 57.8%. Therefore, the four types of parasitic angiosperms varied quite distinctly in terms of distribution patterns across China. Seed plant richness was one of the common leading factors affecting distributions of root parasites, stem parasites, and hemiparasites in China. Besides, the other major influencing factors were the maximum temperature of the warmest month (Bio5), temperature seasonality (Bio4) and precipitation of the warmest quarter (Bio18), and isothermality (Bio3), respectively. Additionally, the main factor affecting holoparasites' distribution was the temperature (Bio3). We found that different parasitic angiosperm types in China were mainly affected by the biotic factor, temperature, and precipitation. In addition, the whole flora of parasites was similar to root parasites and hemiparasites in distribution; nevertheless, its leading factors were the same as those of hemiparasites. Our findings reveal the various responses of different parasitic angiosperm types to the environmental changes across China. It probably comes down to the evolutionary relationships and life strategies among these different types. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, some utilize plants from 13 other families in a further eight orders. We investigated the evolutionary history of host plant use of the Pieridae in the context of a recent phylogenetic hypothesis of the family, using simple character optimization. Although there is a close association between host plant and butterfly higher classification, we find no evidence for cospeciation but a pattern of repeated colonization and specialization. The ancestral host of the family appears to be Fabaceae or Fabales, with multiple independent shifts to other orders, including three to Santalales. The shift to Brassicales, which contain secondary compounds (glucosinolates), promoted diversification and adaptive radiation within the subfamily Pierinae. Subsequent shifts from crucifers to mistletoes (aerial-stem hemiparasites) facilitated further diversification, and more recent shifts from mistletoes to mistletoe host trees led to exploitation of novel host plants outside the conventional three orders. Possible mechanisms underlying these host shifts are briefly discussed. In the Pierinae, a striking association between host plant, larval and adult behaviour, adult phenotype, and mimicry calls for further research into possible relationships between host specialization, plant chemistry and butterfly palatability.","Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Braby, MF (corresponding author), Dept Nat Resources Environm & Arts, Biodivers Conservat Div, POB 496, Palmerston, NT 0831, Australia.",michael.braby@nt.gov.au,"trueman, john/C-9497-2009",,,,,,112,74,82,2,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1010-061X,1420-9101,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

Although its destructive nature is well documented in many respects, its effects on the physiology of its host are poorly understood. In the present study, water and carbon relations were characterized over a range of scale from leaf to whole tree in large (40- to 50-m-tall) individuals of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) that were either heavily infected, or uninfected with hemlock dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium tsugense). Specific hydraulic conductivity (k(s)) of infected branches was approximately half that of uninfected branches, yet leaf-specific conductivity (k(L)) was similar because leaf area : sapwood area ratios (A(L) : A(S)) of infected branches were lower. Pre-dawn and minimum leaf water potential and stomatal conductance (g(s)) were similar among infected and uninfected trees because adjustments in hydraulic architecture of infected trees maintained k(L) despite reduced k(s). Maximum whole-tree water use was substantially lower in infected trees (approximately 55 kg d(-1)) than in uninfected trees (approximately 90 kg d(-1)) because reduced numbers of live branches in infected trees reduced whole-tree A(L) : A(S) in a manner consistent with that observed in infected branches. Maximum photosynthetic rates of heavily infected trees were approximately half those of uninfected trees. Correspondingly, leaf nitrogen content was 35% lower in infected trees. Foliar delta(13)C values were 2.8parts per thousand more negative in infected than in uninfected individuals, consistent with the absence of stomatal adjustment to diminished photosynthetic capacity. Adjustments in hydraulic architecture of infected trees thus contributed to homeostasis of water transport efficiency and transpiration on a leaf area basis, whereas both carbon accumulation and photosynthetic water use efficiency were sharply reduced at both the leaf and whole-tree scale.","US Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, USDA, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Univ Washington, Wind River Canopy Crane Res Facil, Carson, WA 98610 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Oregon State University; University of Washington,"Meinzer, FC (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, USDA, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",fmeinzer@fs.fed.us,"Shaw, David/A-1191-2018; Meinzer, Frederick/N-8373-2019; Meinzer, Frederick C/C-3496-2012","Shaw, David/0000-0002-3898-782X; Meinzer, Frederick/0000-0003-2387-2031; ",,,,,42,91,95,0,44,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0140-7791,,,PLANT CELL ENVIRON,Plant Cell Environ.,JUL,2004,27,7,,,,,937,946,,10.1111/j.1365-3040.2004.01199.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2004.01199.x,,,10,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,834QH,,Bronze,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000222425100014,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study we present an effective shoot culture micropropagation system for Castilleja applegatei Fern., the wavy-leaved Indian paintbrush. In vitro shoot tips of three C. applegatei clones were cultured for 28 days on woody plant medium (WPM) supplemented with four concentrations of each of three cytokinins. 6-benzylaminopurine (BA), 6-(y.y-dimethylallylamino)-purine (2iP) and zeatin. Responding explants, shoot number per responding explant and shoot length were determined. In vitro rooting of microcuttings cultured for 42 days on media containing three concentrations of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) were also evaluated. A high percent response to shoot induction was observed across all treatments, ranging from 94.5 to 100%. C. applegatei responded best to zeatin, which resulted in both the highest mean shoot number and mean shoot length among the cytokinins tested. The best overall shoot multiplication occurred on media with 4.0 mu M zeatin, yielding a mean shoot number of 4.11 and mean shoot length of 3.95 cm. The mean highest rooting response (66 7%), root number (13.21) and root length (2 73 cm) were obtained on WPM supplemented with 10 mu M IBA. Significant clone x treatment interactions existed for all variables except mean root number, thus the optimum treatments for both shoot multiplication and root induction were clone-dependent. Rooted microcuttings were acclimated ex vitro with an average success rate of 81.2%.

Additionally, untargeted profiling based on high-resolution mass spectrometry targeted different phytochemical classes, namely, polyphenols, terpenoids, and alkaloids. The highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents were detected using methanol as the extraction solvent. Multivariate statistics following the untargeted profiling revealed that the extraction solvent had a hierarchically higher impact than the extraction method when considering the recovery of bioactive compounds. The methanolic extracts displayed the highest radical-scavenging antioxidant capacity, as provided by CUPRAC and FRAP assays. On the other hand, the water extracts (MAC and HAE) and the infusion extract showed the highest activity as metal chelators (25.66-27.51 mg EDTAE/g). Similarly, the water extract obtained by HAE and the infusion extract revealed the highest phosphomolybdenum activity (3.92 & PLUSMN; 0.14 and 3.71 & PLUSMN; 0.01 mmol TE/g, respectively). The different extracts also exhibited different enzyme inhibition potentials. For instance, HAE and MAC ethanolic extracts inhibited only alpha-amylase (0.69 & PLUSMN; 0.01 and 0.70 & PLUSMN; 0.01 mmol ACAE/g), while all the other extracts showed a dual inhibition against both carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes tested (i.e., alpha-amylase: 0.07-0.69 mmol ACAE/g; alpha-glucosidase: 0.03-1.30 mmol ACAE/g). Nevertheless, the other extracts inhibited acetyl-, butyryl-cholinesterases, or both; MAC-water extract displayed no inhibition against the enzymes. Additionally, all the studied extracts were found to inhibit tyrosinase, ranging from 10.62 to 52.80 mg KAE/g. In general, the water extracts showed weaker inhibition towards the enzymes than the other extracts. This study demonstrated that R. angustifolius is an excellent source of natural antioxidants and enzyme inhibitors that could be further investigated and exploited for pharmaceutical purposes.","[Zhang, Leilei; Rocchetti, Gabriele; Lucini, Luigi] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Sustainable Food Proc, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy; [Zengin, Gokhan] Selcuk Univ, Sci Fac, Dept Biol, TR-42130 Konya, Turkey; [Senkardes, Ismail] Marmara Univ, Pharm Fac, Dept Pharmaceut Bot, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey; [Sharmeen, Jugreet B.; Mahomoodally, Mohamad Fawzi] Univ Mauritius, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Sci, Reduit 230, Mauritius; [Behl, Tapan] Chitkara Univ, Chitkara Coll Pharm, Rajpura 140401, Punjab, India; [Rouphael, Youssef] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr, I-80138 Naples, Italy","Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Selcuk University; Marmara University; University of Mauritius; Chitkara University, Punjab; University of Naples Federico II","Rocchetti, G (corresponding author), Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Sustainable Food Proc, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.;Zengin, G (corresponding author), Selcuk Univ, Sci Fac, Dept Biol, TR-42130 Konya, Turkey.;Rouphael, Y (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr, I-80138 Naples, Italy.",leilei.zhang@unicatt.it; gokhanzengin@selcuk.edu.tr; gabriele.rocchetti@unicatt.it; isenkardes@marmara.edu.tr; sharmeenjugs@gmail.com; Emahomoodally@uom.ac.mu; tapanbeh131@gmail.com; youssef.rouphael@unina.it; luigi.lucini@unicatt.it,"Lucini, Luigi/L-1503-2013; Zengin, Gokhan/GLS-8806-2022","Lucini, Luigi/0000-0002-5133-9464; Zengin, Gokhan/0000-0001-6548-7823; Jugreet, Bibi Sharmeen/0000-0003-1391-5982; Senkardes, Ismail/0000-0002-2656-0319; Rocchetti, Gabriele/0000-0003-3488-4513; Rouphael, Youssef/0000-0002-1002-8651; Zhang, Leilei/0000-0002-9278-0459",,,,,51,1,1,4,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

These remnants, all protected and managed nature preserves, are rectangular in shape and range in area from 1.29 ha to 1.77 ha; each is bordered by cropland and unmanaged or mowed ruderal grassland. A stratified sampling design was established using permanently marked transects oriented perpendicular to the long axis of each site. Vegetation data were collected in 50 cm X 50 cm quadrats along each transect; prairies were resampled 5-6 yr following baseline data collection. The null expectations were no differences between edge and interior zones, no differences between edge type (crop and noncrop), and no change over time. Results from linear mixed-effects models identified significant differences between edge and interior zones for native species density, native diversity, dominance, percent native cover, and measures of floristic quality; however, there were no time differences and no significant zone 3 time interactions. Distance from edge to peak levels of species density and diversity was about 15 m yielding core habitats 43% to 50% of remnant size. Beta diversity based on species presence was greater in edge zones compared to interior zones, and declined slightly in repeated samples. Functional group diversity was lower in edge zones compared to interior zones and declined significantly in the repeated samples. Functional groups with significant affiliation to the edge zone were nonnative grasses, woody vines, ferns/allies, and nonnative legumes; FGs affiliated with the interior zone were C-4 grasses, hemiparasites, nitrogen-fixing shrubs, and perennial forbs. One site was sampled three times following 5-6 yr intervals and there were no additional within-site differences in the third sample. These prairies support a rich diversity of native species; however, patterns suggest they are effectively smaller than they appear with a trend of declining functional diversity.","[Taft, John B.] Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",Illinois Natural History Survey; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Taft, JB (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",jtaft@illinois.edu,,,,,,,74,2,3,0,28,TORREY BOTANICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",1095-5674,1940-0616,,J TORREY BOT SOC,J.

Many studies implemented during the last few decades have revealed considerable changes in acacia populations, including high mortality rates and low recruitment. The objective of this study aimed to examine the relationships between presumed water availability for acacia populations and their mortality by examining the effect on tree mortality of latitude, basin size, and microhabitat in the valley floor. A total of 1980 acacia trees in 11 wadis along the Arava and eastern Negev region were studied. The obtained results revealed a highly varied inter-wadi mortality rate, ranging between 6.7% and 72.2%. Overall, mortality within species occurred in 14.7% of Acacia pachyceras, 16.8% of Acacia tortilis, and 29.4% of Acacia raddiana. A highly negative correlation coefficient (r = -0.55; P < 0.0001) was found between latitude and acacia mortality. However, a low and not statistically significant correlation coefficient was found between basin size and acacia mortality (r = 024; P = 0.2103). In terms of overall occurrence in microhabitat across the valley floor, 6.4% of the trees were located in main channels, 9.8% in high banks, 10.4% in bars, 19.1% in secondary channels, and 54.3% in low banks. However, the effect of microhabitat on acacia mortality rates was not statistically significant (P = 0.2240). In addition to these, we monitored the occurrence of the hemiparasite, mistletoe (Plicosepalus acaciae), which was observed in 82% of the trees. Also, the tree canopies' height and diameter were measured in order to calculate a size index for them. Values of this index were divided into four groups in order to represent the size distribution of trees. The overall occurrence of 3.6% of the smallest tree-size group is worrisome, as it presumably indicates very low recruitment rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, resistance to herbivory in flowers has received very little attention, even though reproductive tissues are often essential for plant reproduction. Plants may protect reproductive tissues with a range of defenses from constitutive to induced, although ecological costs associated with constitutive defense or resistance are expected to be higher than costs associated with induced responses. Induced responses in flowers may be effective against floral herbivores while minimizing the negative impacts of resistance on pollinators. This study examines induced responses in Nemophila menziesii (Hydrophyllaceae), a plant that frequently receives high levels of floral herbivory. I report that natural caterpillar herbivory increased levels of resistance against caterpillars later in the season. Similarly, artificial clipping to flowers consistently reduced natural damage to flowers vs unclipped controls over two years. Neither whole-plant nor individual seed set was affected by the reduction of floral damage. Induced resistance in reproductive tissues may benefit plants that are exposed to both floral herbivory and pollinator activity and can be an important link between plant antagonists and plant mutualists.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"McCall, AC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",acmccall@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,37,27,28,0,21,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2006,112,3,,,,,660,666,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.13981.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.13981.x,,,7,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,005CS,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000234800800019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our work, analyze dispersion and colonization attribute of the hemiparasitic plant Misodendrum punctulatum (Misodendraceae). Our hypothesis outline that the wind dispersal pattern of M. punctulatum seeds determine the infection pattern (colonization) on Nothofagus antarctica, and both processes (dispersion and colonization) are asymmetric in accordance with the predominant wind direction. This study was carry out in a N. antarctica (host) post-fire shrubland. We assessed the seed dispersal estimating number of seed on host branches supplied from infected-survivals hosts (focal host) toward each cardinal direction. Colonization was assessed estimating number of infections on each host, through transects, at every cardinal direction from the focal host. We observed that seeds dispersed decline with distances from the seed source, and dispersion fitted to a negative exponential model. The longest distance of primary dispersion observed was 10 m toward east. About colonization, longest distance from the focal host was 22.5 m toward south. Furthermore, ratio of infected host was lesser on west, one infected by 10 uninfected (1:10) than other compass aspects (1:6). Both process, dispersion and colonization, showed a similar and asymmetric pattern of distribution, which could be result of wind direction predominant from northwest. In addition, a high spatial correlation was observed among number of seed dispersed and recruitment of infection in distances from the sources of seeds. Our results allow understand the patterns of spatial distribution and infection dynamics of Misodendrum punctulatum. In order to plan management strategies, understanding the infection dynamics is useful to perform successfully strategies to the control of hemiparasitic plants in forest to commercial use, and conservation or restoration strategies, e.g. to restorate this hemiparasitic specie in areas recently colonized by N. antarctica. These studied aspects in Misodendrum punctulatum contribute to the knowledge of this ecological interaction, which is frequent in Nothofagus forests from Argentina and Chile.","[Tercero-Bucardo, Norlan] Univ Nacl Comahue, Lab Ecotonoctr Reg Univ Bariloche, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Universidad Nacional del Comahue; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Tercero-Bucardo, N (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, Lab Ecotonoctr Reg Univ Bariloche, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",ntbucardo@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,11,11,0,13,SOC BIOLGIA CHILE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 16164, SANTIAGO 9, CHILE",0716-078X,,,REV CHIL HIST NAT,Rev.

Parasitic plants, (mistletoes) may alter the growth, reproduction and physiology of their hosts. Mimoso calodendron (Fabaceae) is a legume abundant in rupestrian fields on ironstone outcrops. frequently attacked by the hemiparasite Struthanthus flexicaulis (Loranthaceae). The objective of this study was to evaluate the consequences of parasitism by S. flexicaulis on the fitness of M. calodendron. The intensity of parasitism and mortality on hosts of different sizes was evaluated, and foliage cover, fruit and seed set in parasitized and non-parasitized individuals were compared. More than 65% of a population of 1820 individuals was attacked. Host density positively influenced parasitism. The mortality anti number of attacked hosts increased with their crown diameter. Heavily parasitized individuals showed 75 to 95% reduction of leaf cover and fruit production of 25% of those non-parasitized. Although no statistical difference was detected between the number of seeds per fruit, seed weight was lower in attacked plants. Parasitism by S. flexicaulis on M. calodendron may alter its population structure and dynamics, by reducing Survival and fecundity rates.","[Mourao, Fabiana Alves; Jacobi, Claudia Maria; Cortes Figueira, Jose Eugenio; Luciano Batista, Eugenia Kelly] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Geral, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Mourao, FA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Geral, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",fabimourao@gmail.com,"Jacobi, Claudia M/B-7510-2013; Côrtes-Figueira, José Eugênio/D-3933-2016","Côrtes-Figueira, José Eugênio/0000-0001-6399-2025",FAPEMIG (Minas Gerais Research Funding Agency [CRA 89/04]; US Fish and Wildlife Service,FAPEMIG (Minas Gerais Research Funding Agency(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); US Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service),"We thank Marcos Sobral, Pedro L.

Given predicted increases in drought frequency and intensity, mistletoes may be crucial for moderating drought impacts on community structure. Dependent on host vascular flows, mistletoes can succumb to stress when water availability falls, making them susceptible to mortality during drought. We counted mistletoe across greater than 350 000 km(2) of southeastern Australia and conducted standardized bird surveys between 2016 and 2021, spanning a major drought event in 2018-2019. We aimed to identify predictors of mistletoe abundance and mortality and determine whether mistletoes might moderate drought impacts on woodland birds. Live mistletoe abundance varied with tree species composition, land use and presence of mistletoebirds. Mistletoe mortality was widespread, consistent with high 2018/2019 summer temperatures, low 2019/2020 summer rainfall and the interaction between summer temperatures and rainfall in 2019/2020. The positive association between surviving mistletoes and woodland birds was greatest in the peak drought breeding seasons of 2018/2019 and 2019/2020, particularly for small residents and insectivores. Paradoxically, mistletoes could moderate drought impacts on birds, but are themselves vulnerable to drought-induced mortality. An improved understanding of the drivers and dynamics of mistletoe mortality is needed to address potential cascading trophic impacts associated with mistletoe die-off.","[Crates, Ross; Murphy, Liam; Rayner, Laura; Stojanovic, Dejan; Heinsohn, Robert] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Linnaeus Way,Acton, Canberra 2601, Australia; [Bonnet, Timothee] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Linnaeus Way,Acton, Canberra 2601, Australia; [Watson, David M.] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Agr Environm & Vet Sci, Albury, NSW, Australia; [Albery, Gregory F.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Biol, Washington, DC USA; [Timewell, Chris; Meney, Beau; Roderick, Mick; Ingwersen, Dean] BirdLife Australia, Melbourne, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University; Charles Sturt University; Georgetown University,"Crates, R (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Linnaeus Way,Acton, Canberra 2601, Australia.",ross.crates@anu.edu.au,"; Bonnet, Timothee/B-8899-2015","David, Watson/0000-0003-1821-4632; Stojanovic, Dejan/0000-0002-1176-3244; Bonnet, Timothee/0000-0001-7186-5288; Albery, Gregory/0000-0001-6260-2662; Heinsohn, Robert/0000-0002-2514-9448",Australian government's National Landcare Program 2 via NSW Local Land Services; NSW government's Saving our Species programme; CWP renewables; Mach Energy,Australian government's National Landcare Program 2 via NSW Local Land Services; NSW government's Saving our Species programme; CWP renewables; Mach Energy,"This study was funded by the Australian government's National Landcare Program 2 via NSW Local Land Services, CWP renewables, Mach Energy and the NSW government's Saving our Species programme.",,60,2,3,1,3,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

The genus Cuscuta comprises about 200 species, many of which can cause severe problems for certain crops. The parasitic process in Cuscuta begins in finding and attaching to a host plant and then developing a haustorium. The process does not always require any chemical signal, but does require a light signal. Finding a host involves detecting the lower red light: far-red light ratio near a potential host plant by phytochrome. A contact signal is also necessary for haustorium induction. Apparently, cytokinin increase is downstream of the light and contact signal and is critical for haustorium induction. This pathway, however, appears to be slightly different from a standard pathway. The direct connection between Cuscuta and its host involves both the xylem and phloem, and mRNA and proteins can translocate. Several features indicate that Cuscuta is a useful model plant for parasite plant research as well as plant-plant interaction research. These include the simple anatomical structure and seedling development, no chemical requirement for haustorium induction, and the wide range of host plants.","[Furuhashi, Takeshi; Weckwerth, Wolfram] Univ Vienna, Dept Mol Syst Biol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Furuhashi, Katsuhisa] Maeda Inst Plant Resources, Dept Parasit Plant Physiol, Meito Ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",University of Vienna,"Furuhashi, T (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Mol Syst Biol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",takeshi.furuhashi@univie.ac.at,"Weckwerth, Wolfram/G-5811-2010","Weckwerth, Wolfram/0000-0002-9719-6358",,,,,81,35,39,4,69,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-9145,1742-9153,,J PLANT INTERACT,J.

Mainly the biology reproduction of this mistletoe lies in bright colored flower development. Furthermore, it uses the nectar secretion as the only reward to engage different flower visitors. We investigated the physiological mechanisms of the flower phenology per hour and per day to analyze the spatial-temporal patterns of the nectar secretion, Cell Wall Invertase Activity (key enzyme in the quality of nectar), nectar chemistry, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emission, synthesis of carotenoids and frequency of floral visitors. Flowers lasted 4 days, total nectar was loaded just before the anthesis and the secretion was maintained over day 1 and 2, decreased on day 3, and stopped on day 4. The diurnal nectar secretion dynamic per hour on day 1 and 2 showed similar patterns with high production on the morning and a decrease in the afternoon, the secretion declined on day 3 and ceased on day 4. On the other hand, CWIN activity per day was less before the anthesis and increased on day 1 and 2, this enzymatic activity decreased on the old flower phenology. Moreover, diurnal CWIN activities showed different patterns in the morning, noon, and lastly in the afternoon. Nectar chemistry varied significantly throughout of the flower lifetime, sucrose decreased along the flower phenology increasing glucose and fructose. Amino acids showed the prevalence of proline and oxo-proline, both increased on the day 1 and diminished in subsequent old flower stages. The spatial VOCs emission showed the presence of 11 compounds being beta-ocimene the main volatile; its release increased on day 1 and remained constant in the flower lifetime. Lutein, lycopene, and beta-carotene were concentrated in old stages of the flowers. In field, the most frequent flower visitors were the hummingbirds that usually foraging in all phenologic flower stage and their foraging events decreased with the phenological flower lifetimes. The results showed that these traits presented by P. calyculatus flowers are able to engage and manipulate the behavior of flower visitors and contribute to the reproduction of the parasitic plant.","[Quintana-Rodriguez, Elizabeth; Camacho-Coronel, Xicotencatl; Heil, Martin] Inst Politecn Nacl, CINVESTAV, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Dept Ingn Genet, Guanajuato, Mexico; [Quintana-Rodriguez, Elizabeth; Esparza-Claudio, Jose; Orona-Tamayo, Domancar] Ctr Innovac Aplicada Tecnol Competit CIATEC, Dept Soluc Tecnol, Guanajuato, Mexico; [Gamaliel Ramirez-Rodriguez, Alan; Ramirez-Chavez, Enrique; Molina-Torres, Jorge; Orona-Tamayo, Domancar] Inst Politecn Nacl, CINVESTAV, Dept Bioquim & Biotecnol, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Guanajuato, Mexico",CINVESTAV - Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional; Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; CIATEC - Centro de Innovacion Aplicada en Tecnologias Competitiva; CINVESTAV - Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional; Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico,"Quintana-Rodriguez, E; Heil, M (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, CINVESTAV, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Dept Ingn Genet, Guanajuato, Mexico.;Quintana-Rodriguez, E; Orona-Tamayo, D (corresponding author), Ctr Innovac Aplicada Tecnol Competit CIATEC, Dept Soluc Tecnol, Guanajuato, Mexico.;Orona-Tamayo, D (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, CINVESTAV, Dept Bioquim & Biotecnol, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Guanajuato, Mexico.",lizquir@hotmail.com; equintana@ciatec.mx; martin.heil@cinvestav.mx; domancar@gmail.com,"Torres, Jorge Molina/B-9325-2019; Heil, Martin/T-3960-2019; Heil, Martin/AAC-2730-2022","Heil, Martin/0000-0001-8036-8697; Esparza Claudio, Jose de Jesus/0000-0002-3503-4636; camacho, xicotencatl/0000-0002-2105-3086",incentive of National Research System (SNI) of Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT); project Bioturbosin Cluster of Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) [208090]; Secretaria de Energia (SENER),incentive of National Research System (SNI) of Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); project Bioturbosin Cluster of Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Secretaria de Energia (SENER),"This research was supported by the incentive of National Research System (SNI), and supported by the project Bioturbosin Cluster (208090) both of Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) and Secretaria de Energia (SENER).",,63,7,8,0,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

In several lineages of aerobic microbial eukaryotes, complex I has been lost, with an alternative, nuclear-encoded NADH dehydrogenase shown in certain cases to bypass complex I and oxidize NADH without proton translocation. The first loss of complex I in any multicellular eukaryote was recently reported in two studies; one sequenced the complete mitogenome of the hemiparasitic aerial mistletoe, Viscum scurruloideum, and the other sequenced the V. album mitogenome. The V. scurruloideum study reported no significant additional loss of mitochondrial genes or genetic function, but the V. album study postulated that mitochondrial genes encoding all ribosomal RNAs and proteins of all respiratory complexes are either absent or pseudogenes, thus raising questions as to whether the mitogenome and oxidative respiration are functional in this plant. Results: To determine whether these opposing conclusions about the two Viscum mitogenomes reflect a greater degree of reductive/degenerative evolution in V. album or instead result from interpretative and analytical differences, we reannotated and reanalyzed the V. album mitogenome and compared it with the V. scurruloideum mitogenome. We find that the two genomes share a complete complement of mitochondrial rRNA genes and a typical complement of genes encoding respiratory complexes II-V. Most Viscum mitochondrial protein genes exhibit very high levels of divergence yet are evolving under purifying, albeit relaxed selection. We discover two cases of horizontal gene transfer in V. album and show that the two Viscum mitogenomes differ by 8.6-fold in size (66 kb in V. scurruloideum; 565 kb in V. album). Conclusions: Viscum mitogenomes are extraordinary compared to other plant mitogenomes in terms of their wide size range, high rates of synonymous substitutions, degree of relaxed selection, and unprecedented loss of respiratory complex I. However, contrary to the initial conclusions regarding V. album, both Viscum mitogenomes possess conventional sets of rRNA and, excepting complex I, respiratory genes. Both plants should therefore be able to carry out aerobic respiration. Moreover, with respect to size, the V. scurruloideum mitogenome has experienced a greater level of reductive evolution.","[Skippington, Elizabeth; Rice, Danny W.; Palmer, Jeffrey D.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Barkman, Todd J.] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Skippington, Elizabeth] Genentech Inc, Dept Bioinformat & Computat Biol, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Western Michigan University; Roche Holding; Genentech,"Palmer, JD (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jpalmer@indiana.edu,,"Rice, Danny/0000-0002-1123-4617",National Science Foundation [IOS-1027529],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by National Science Foundation award IOS-1027529 to J.D.P.,,45,39,39,0,22,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2229,,,BMC PLANT BIOL,BMC Plant Biol.,FEB 21,2017,17,,,,,,,,49,10.1186/s12870-017-0992-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-017-0992-8,,,12,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,EL7TD,28222679,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-05-23,WOS:000394822600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many grasslands in north-west Europe are productive but species-poor communities resulting from intensive agriculture. Reducing the intensity of management under agri-environment schemes has often failed to increase botanical diversity. We investigated biotic and abiotic constraints on diversification by manipulating seed and microsite availability, soil fertility, resource competition, herbivory and deficiencies in the soil microbial community. 2. The effectiveness of 13 restoration treatments was investigated over 4 years in a randomized block experiment established in two productive grasslands in central-east and south-west England. 3. Severe disturbance involving turf removal followed by seed addition was the most effective and reliable means of increasing grassland diversity. Disturbance by multiple harrowing was moderately effective but was enhanced by molluscicide application to reduce seedling herbivory and by sowing the hemiparasite Rhinanthus to reduce competition from grasses. 4. Low-level disturbance by grazing or slot-seeding was ineffective in increasing diversity. Inoculation with soil microbial communities from species-rich grasslands had no effect on botanical diversity. Nitrogen and potassium fertilizer addition accelerated off-take of phosphorus in cut herbage but did not cause a reduction in soil phosphorus or increase botanical diversity. 5. Different grazing management regimes had little impact on diversity. This may reflect the constraining effect of the July hay cut on species dispersal and colonization. 6. Synthesis and applications. Three alternative approaches to grassland diversification, with different outcomes, are recommended. (i) High intervention deturfing, which would create patches with low competitive conditions for rapid and reliable establishment of the target community. For reasons of cost and practicality this can only be done over small areas but will form source populations for subsequent spread. (ii) Moderate intervention (harrowing or slot-seeding) over large areas, which would establish a limited number of desirable, generalist species that perform well in restoration. This method is low cost and rapid but the increases in biodiversity are less predictable. (iii) Phased restoration, which would complement the above approaches.

Here the effect of the holoparasitic endophyte Bdallophyton americanum (R. Br.) Harms on the root conductivity of Bursera simaruba (L.) Sarg. was studied. Parasitized and non-parasitized root segments were sampled in the rainy and dry seasons in a dry coastal forest in central Veracruz, Mexico. Root diameter, hydraulic (K (h)) and specific conductivity (K-s = K-h/root transverse area), percent loss of conductivity and reproductive specific conductivity (K-h/inflorescence or infructescense dry weight) data were obtained. The diameter and number of conductive and non-conductive vessels were recorded in parasitized and non-parasitized root segments in the dry season. Root diameters were not different between root types and seasons, but root specific conductivity was different both between seasons and root types. Specific conductivity on parasitized roots was 61% (wet season) and 85% (dry season) lower than that recorded for non-parasitized roots in the wet season. Root hydraulic conductivity was positively related with the biomass of reproductive structures of B. americanum in the wet season. The parasite appears to alter the xylem morphogenesis of the host, reducing vessel number by 40%, but not plugging or otherwise harming the conductive vessels, and resulted in no change in vessel diameter. Contrary to what has been reported to occur in some plant stems infected with hemiparasitic mistletoes, B. americanum decreases but does not eliminate conductivity to the distal plant parts.","Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Funct, Xalapa 91000, Veracruz, Mexico; Inst Ecol, Dept Prod Forestales, Skopje 91000, Macedonia",Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico,"Garcia-Franco, JG (corresponding author), Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Funct, Apartado Pstal 63, Xalapa 91000, Veracruz, Mexico.",franco@inecol.edu.mx,"Garcia-Franco, Jose G./Q-4574-2019; López-Portillo, Jorge/L-2492-2014; Angeles, Guillermo/Q-6277-2018; Garcia-Franco, Jose G./M-3483-2014; Angeles, Guillermo/O-9675-2019","Garcia-Franco, Jose G./0000-0003-0540-6045; López-Portillo, Jorge/0000-0002-6827-3297; Garcia-Franco, Jose G./0000-0003-0540-6045; Angeles, Guillermo/0000-0002-0455-4997",,,,,30,5,8,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

There are a variety of cell types within the host which parasitic plants could access to extract solutes. Depending on the degree to which the parasite has embraced the parasitic lifestyle, the extent of solute flux and the pathways used to transfer solutes from host to parasite will vary. To date, a variety of experimental approaches argue for diversity in the mechanisms and the routes by which parasites accumulate host solutes. Contact between host and parasite ranges from direct lumen-to-lumen links between host and parasite xylem and continuity between the sieve elements of host and parasite, to the involvement of transfer cells between host and parasite. Progress has been slow since Solms-Laubach distinguished types of parasitic plants that fed from host phloem or xylem in 1867, but advances in clearly delineating the pathways that link host and parasite should now be possible using fluorescent proteins expressed and restricted to particular cell types of the host. This will initially necessitate using Arabidopsis, but should allow the types of connection, i.e. symplasmic or apoplasmic, to be determined and then the identification of parasite transporters responsible for solute flux.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; Julius von Sachs Inst Biowissensch, Lehrstuhl Bot 1, D-97082 Wurzburg, Germany",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Cambridge; University of Wurzburg,"Hibberd, JM (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England.",,,,,,,,37,94,100,2,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0022-0957,,,J EXP BOT,J.

For the experiments, seeds of Pedicularis sceptrum-carolinum L. (Lamiales, Orobanchaceae) were collected in the first decade of September in the vicinity of Chashnitskoe Lake. The study of specifics of germination of seeds and the initial stages of the development of P. sceptrum-carolinum was carried out in controlled laboratory conditions in a climate chamber with illumination (1,200-1,500 lux, photoperiod of 9/15, temperature of 23-25 degrees C). After a month-long storage of seeds in their fruit capsules in the laboratory conditions, the greatest germination (83.3-93.3%) was achieved after their subsequent dry maintenance (taken out of the fruits) in a refrigerator at the temperature of +2...+3 degrees C for 3 or 6 months. Lower values of final germination were obtained after maintaining dry seeds at the temperature of -24...-28 degrees C for 3 months. Increasing periods of such storage up to six months led to decrease in the final germination and energy of germination. After-ripening lasting different periods provided lower values of the two most important parameters - final germination and energy of germination, even in cases of quite long periods of dry storage in the laboratory. The initial stages of the development of plants from seeds of P. sceptrum-carolinum, which had undergone 3-month stratification in a refrigerator, were studied during the period of 2.0 (2.5) months in different conditions: Petri dishes on moistened filter paper, and in glass vessels with settled tap water, in soil in a plastic container (pure groups of sowed seeds) and also in soil sown together with seeds of Avena sativa L., with seeds put singly into a plastic block of 9 cassettes. The study revealed morphological differences in plants that had developed over the two-months growth, in each variant of the experiment. We recorded fragmentary development of haustorial hairs on the lateral roots of the plants in the pure sown group and also the haustorium in the group sown together with common oat. We achieved no further development and the plants died. The plants grew for a longer period (2.5 months) in the pure sown groups, which then died as well. The study we performed may be a basis for preparing successful introduction and cultivation of P. sceptrum-carolinum, which would be an important source of preservation of a species that raises concerns on account of the rapid decreases in its populations, narrowing of its range and rare occurrence.","[Lapirov, A.

Tapinanthus species are locally known as all purpose herbs as they are traditionally used to treat various diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, inflammation, malaria, anemia, anxiety, itching, and so on.Aim of the study: A comprehensive review on research outcomes and future perspectives of Tapinanthus species are presented to provide a reference for relevant researchers.Materials and methods: The references regarding Tapinanthus species were retrieved from Google Scholar, Web of Science, Sci-finder, PubMed, Elsevier, Wiley, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Open Access Library, and SpringerLink between 1963 and 2022. Scientific plant names were provided by The Plant List (www.theplan tlist.org) and The world Flora Online (www.worldfloraonline.org).Results: Even though Tapinanthus species are regarded as notorious pests that can undermine various hosts, they are, as omnipotent herbs in folklore, meaningful for the development of potential phytomedicine sources. Phytochemistry screening has revealed the presence of glycosides, triterpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, steroids, anthraquinones. Among them, the chemical structures of 40 compounds have been elucidated by phytochemical methods without alkaloids and anthraquinones. These secondary metabolites might be responsible for ethnomedical uses and bioactivities of Tapinanthus species. Current research has provided scientific evidence for traditional uses of Tapinanthus species, especially unraveling hypoglycemic, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-anxiety, anti-depression, anti-inflammatory, and other pharmacological properties. Given the fact that ethnomedical uses served as a valuable reference for pharmacology, however, some records to treat arthritis, fever, itching, dysentery, stomach pain, and anemia, have not been confirmed in current research. Furthermore, the toxic effects of Tapinanthus species were susceptible to the dosages, with relative safety across a wide range.Conclusions: To reasonably yield Tapinanthus species, artificial culture might be a promising method to develop in the future. The discrepancies between phytochemistry screening and structure elucidation, as well as between ethnomedical uses and current pharmacology, need to be further clarified. The identification of bioactive compounds in crude extracts and fractions, the illustration of the underlying mechanisms of pharmacology, along with the addition of cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and clinical trials of toxic tests, should be carried out in depth. This review highlights that Tapinanthus species can be considered promising phytomedicine sources as long as we adhere to digging more deeply into their potential role.","[Wang, Lu; Kong, Degang; Tian, Jinli; Zhao, Wei; Chen, Yueru; An, Ying; Liu, Xue; Wang, Fulin; Cai, Fujie; Sun, Xiaohui; Liu, Qing; Zhang, Wenru; Tian, Jingzhen; Zhou, Honglei] Shandong Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Coll Pharm, Jinan 250355, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,"Zhou, HL (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Coll Pharm, Jinan 250355, Shandong, Peoples R China.",zhouhongleitcm@126.com,"Chen, Yueru/GWC-9924-2022; tian, jinli/HIR-4621-2022",,"Project of the Shandong Province Key Research and Development Program [2021CXGC010511, SDYKC21051, 2021047]",Project of the Shandong Province Key Research and Development Program,"Acknowledgments This work was funded by the Project of the Shandong Province Key Research and Development Program (2021CXGC010511) , the project of Shandong postgraduate education quality curriculum (SDYKC21051) , and the innovation training program for college students of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (2021047) .",,164,1,1,11,20,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0378-8741,1872-7573,,J ETHNOPHARMACOL,J.

It has been overexploited for its oil-yielding heartwood and is now threatened. Remaining stands lack genetic diversity and are likely to be suffering from inbreeding depression, although the species still has significant genetic diversity overall. We argue that the best way to conserve this species is through an active domestication program that will adequately sample and conserve the genetic base in ex situ and circa situm plantings. The approach to S. yasi tree-breeding can be characterised as a low-input strategy involving the early use of molecular markers for population parameter determination. Long-term success will have strong interdependent links with the conservation of the remaining genetic resources. A strategy based on recurrent selection and breeding for key traits-including heartwood volume and oil yield per year, oil quality and environmental adaptability related to cyclone resistance and the tolerance of pests and diseases-is recommended. The establishment of genetic conservation stands based on collections of the species throughout its natural range in Fiji and Tonga has commenced. Challenges associated with the conservation and domestication of S. yasi are discussed. These include the advanced age required before oil characterisation can be undertaken; the need to assess genotype-host-plant interactions; and the need for comparatively sophisticated equipment and destructive harvesting to carry out oil assessments. Capacity development of professional staff in the Pacific Islands is an additional prerequisite for implementing an effective strategy. Research into the variation and heritability of heartwood formation and oil characteristics, and a better understanding of the breeding biology of S. yasi and geneflow between it and exotic Indian sandalwood (S. album), are high priorities. It will be more than a decade-probably around 20 years-before S. yasi individuals in planned, well-designed trial plantings have sufficient heartwood development to enable oil-trait assessment. Establishment of such trials is an immediate priority. In addition to this long-term activity, we recommend a simple interim strategy that promotes high genetic diversity of seedling-based planting stock. This can be implemented using a combination of gene conservation stands, progeny trials that can be culled to seedling seed orchards, and genetically diverse community-based seed stands. The strategy will both provide a safeguard against the further loss of diversity and promote wide outcrossing. Releasing fragmented populations from inbreeding depression is expected to increase general vigour.","[Bush, D.] CSIRO, Australian Tree Seed Ctr, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Thomson, L.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Australian Ctr Pacific Isl Res, Maroochydore, Australia; [Bolatolu, W.; Tauraga, J.] Minist Forests, Silviculture Res Div, Suva, Fiji; [Dutt, S.] Minist Agr & Food Forests & Fisheries, Forestry Div, Nukualofa, Tonga; [Hamani, S.; Likiafu, H.] Minist Forests, Div Forestry Off, Cent Eastern, Suva, Fiji; [Mateboto, J.; Young, E.] Pacific Community, Land Resources Div, Suva, Fiji",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of the Sunshine Coast,"Bush, D (corresponding author), CSIRO, Australian Tree Seed Ctr, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",david.bush@csiro.au,"Bush, David J/E-9139-2011","Bush, David J/0000-0002-8113-0231; Thomson, Lex/0000-0002-2984-0711",,,,,55,8,8,2,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AUSTRALIA,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 2, 11 QUEENS RD, MELBOURNE, VIC 3004, AUSTRALIA",0004-9158,2325-6087,,AUST FORESTRY,Austral.

The interplay between dispersal and adaptation to local environments ultimately determines the distribution of plant species, but their relative contribution remains little understood. Tropical mistletoes provide the opportunity to dissect these contributions of dispersal and adaptation, because as hemiparasitic plants, they are typically adapted to grow on a handful of species within diverse tropical communities and are non-randomly dispersed by mutualistic frugivorous birds. 2. Here we hypothesized that the primary determinant of the abundance of a tropical mistletoe (Dendropemon caribaeus, Loranthaceae) in Puerto Rico will be the compatibility between the mistletoe and plant species in a community. 3. Alternatively, the mistletoe's abundance could be primarily shaped by other factors such as the availability of potential host plants, or factors that determine how mistletoe seeds are dispersed by avian frugivores. We conducted surveys and experiments to assess the capacity of this mistletoe to grow on trees available in the local community, and measured the monthly phenology and seed dispersal patterns of the mistletoe and other bird-dispersed plants in the community over a period of 4years. A path model was used to evaluate how the abundance of the mistletoe was shaped by host abundance, fruiting phenology, bird dispersal and compatibilities with host plants. 3. Our analyses show that the compatibility between mistletoe and host tree species, measured by mistletoe survival and growth rate, was the most important factor for mistletoe abundance. The next most important factor was the phenological characteristics of the hosts; this outcome likely arose because frugivory and seed dispersal services for mistletoes and hosts are performed by the same birds. 4. Synthesis. Mistletoes often parasitize only a subset of the suitable plant species that are available in a given community. Our results indicate that such patterns are not only determined by host quality and abundance but also by the phenological patterns of trees that influence the probabilities of mistletoe seeds being deposited on them by shared avian seed dispersers.","[Caraballo-Ortiz, Marcos A.; Gonzalez-Castro, Aaron; dePamphilis, Claude W.; Carlo, Tomas A.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Gonzalez-Castro, Aaron] Isl Ecol & Evolut Res Grp IPNA CSIC, Calle Astrofis Francisco Sanchez 3, E-38206 Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain; [Yang, Suann] SUNY Coll Geneseo, Biol Dept, 1 Coll Circle, Geneseo, NY 14454 USA; [Carlo, Tomas A.] Penn State Univ, Ecol Intercollege Grad Degree Program, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Productos Naturales y Agrobiologia (IPNA); State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Geneseo; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Caraballo-Ortiz, MA (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mac587@psu.edu,"Yang, Suann/C-3759-2008; González-Castro, Aarón/K-3290-2016; Caraballo, Marcos/AAJ-6822-2021; Caraballo-Ortiz, Marcos A./AAJ-1418-2020","González-Castro, Aarón/0000-0002-5311-1017; Caraballo, Marcos/0000-0003-4063-3657; Yang, Suann/0000-0001-7985-3011; Carlo, Tomas/0000-0002-2092-0053","NSF [DEB-1028174, DEB-1145994]; Alfred P.

However, studies with empirical data interrogating this hypothesis are lacking. Weekly monitoring of flowering and fruiting patterns on a generalist mistletoe Dendrophthoe pentandra (Loranthaceae) was conducted for two consecutive years in tropical Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. We examined whether flowering and fruiting patterns were seasonal, quantified the degree of stagger within D. pentandra populations and determined the factors influencing the first flowering date (FFD) of D. pentandra. Furthermore, the effect of change in the number of host species on reproductive phenological asynchrony of mistletoe was examined. We found that (i) both flowering and fruiting exhibited unimodal peaks in the two consecutive years of the study; (ii) the FFD was significantly influenced by crown area of mistletoe and light, such that clump with larger crown and more light exposure had an earlier FFD and longer flowering and fruiting durations; (iii) different host species had a significant impact on the phenology of mistletoes. However, contrary to our hypothesis, the number of host species did not significantly change the asynchrony of reproductive phenology of mistletoe. Therefore, these results suggest that alternative hypotheses are needed to interpret the ecological significance of the number of host species and phenological asynchrony of generalist mistletoes.","[Li, Manru; Chen, Jin; Zhang, Ling] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Mengla 666303, Peoples R China; [Li, Manru] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zhang, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Mengla 666303, Peoples R China.",zhangl@xtbg.org.cn,,"Li, Manru/0000-0002-0989-7278",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31670393],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31670393) to L.Z.,,92,0,0,2,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

This is caused by several species causing serious damage to agriculture and forestry. There is however much more to parasitic plants than presumed weeds. Many parasitic plans exert even positive effects on natural ecosystems and human society, which we review in this paper. Plant parasitism generally reduces the growth and fitness of the hosts. The network created by a parasitic plant attached to multiple host plant individuals may however trigger transferring systemic signals among these. Parasitic plants have repeatedly been documented to play the role of keystone species in the ecosystems. Harmful effects on community dominants, including invasive species, may facilitate species coexistence and thus increase biodiversity. Many parasitic plants enhance nutrient cycling and provide resources to other organisms like herbivores or pollinators, which contributes to facilitation cascades in the ecosystems. There is also a long tradition of human use of parasitic plants for medicinal and cultural purposes worldwide. Few species provide edible fruits. Several parasitic plants are even cultivated by agriculture/forestry for efficient harvesting of their products. Horticultural use of some parasitic plant species has also been considered. While providing multiple benefits, parasitic plants should always be used with care. In particular, parasitic plant species should not be cultivated outside their native geographical range to avoid the risk of their uncontrolled spread and the resulting damage to ecosystems.","[Tesitel, Jakub; Knotkova, Katerina] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic; [Li, Ai-Rong] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Dept Econ Plants & Biotechnol, Yunnan Key Lab Wild Plant Resources, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [McLellan, Richard; Watson, David M.] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Bandaranayake, Pradeepa C.

In the present study, the elemental nutrient status is described forAcacia asak,A. ehrenbergiana,A. gerrardii, andA. tortilisthat were infected with the mistletoePlicosepalus curviflorus, at three levels of infection (no infection, low and high infection). The nutrients of the mistletoe and the soil under the studied acacias were also determined. The elemental contents of the infectedAcaciaspecies were significantly reduced compared to non-infected trees, particularly for potassium and sodium. The reduction in the elemental composition was also species-specific and dependent on infection density. Elemental contents of the mistletoe were significantly higher than theirAcaciahosts, particularly for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and the concentrations of minerals in mistletoe tissues were host- and density-dependent. This study revealed a significant increase in nutrients in the soil beneath the canopy of infectedAcaciacompared to the non-infected trees. Overall, it appears that mistletoe infection has a dual effect. It threatens the health of theAcacia, potentially killing its host tree due to absorption of host nutrients particularly when the infection intense. It also has a positive effect in that it improves the availability of the micro-habitat of nutrients under the canopy, which in turn may contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity.","[Al-Rowaily, Saud L.; Al-Nomari, Gameel S.

The mistletoe Psittacanthus schiedeanus (Loranthaceae) was studied for a five-month period in cloud forest remnants in central Veracruz, Mexico, to determine its seed dispersal ecology. We hypothesized that dispersal ecology of this mistletoe species is directly affected by the fruit-eating bird abundance, and asked if this species is following the high-investment strategy as suggested by Godschalk (1983). To evaluate this, we determined the morphological and nutritional characteristics of mistletoe fruit, the availability of ripe fruits along the mistletoe fruiting phenology. and the abundance of fruit-eating birds. Because P schiedeanus is dispersed by generalist rather than specialist birds, we asked if this mistletoe species is ripening fruits during the fruit scarcity time (with highest possibilities of being consumed and dispersed by birds). We compared P schiedeanus ripe fruit production to the cloud forest tree leaf fall and fruit production. Psittacanthus schiedeanus matures its nutritious fruits from November to April, with a peak of abundance in January and February. We found a synchrony between the abundance of P schiedeanus ripe fruits and the abundance of Gray Silky-flycatchers (Ptilogonys cinereus) and Social Flycatchers (Myiozetetes similis); however, this was not the case with Cedar Waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum), although these birds play an important role in the mistletoe dispersal. The fruiting pattern of P schiedeanus, together with the fact that it is an important food resource for generalist rather than specialist frugivorous birds, suggest that this mistletoe is using the nutrient investment strategy to attract dispersers during a time of fruit scarcity.","Inst Ecol AC, Dept Ecol & Comportamiento Anim, Xalapa 91000, Veracruz, Mexico",Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico,"Ornelas, JF (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC, Dept Ecol & Comportamiento Anim, Km 2-5 Antigua Carretera & Coatepec,Apdo Postal 6, Xalapa 91000, Veracruz, Mexico.",,"de Buen, Lorena Lopez/AAX-9104-2020; DE BUEN, LORENA LOPEZ/Y-5782-2019; Ornelas, Juan Francisco/A-2250-2014","de Buen, Lorena Lopez/0000-0003-4283-302X; Ornelas, Juan Francisco/0000-0002-1124-1163",,,,,46,30,33,0,15,ASSOC TROPICAL BIOLOGY INC,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0006-3606,,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,SEP,2001,33,3,,,,,487,494,,10.1646/0006-3606(2001)033[0487:SDOTMP]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1646/0006-3606(2001)033[0487:SDOTMP]2.0.CO;2,,,8,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,484VG,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000171709800011,View Full Record in Web of Science

We assessed growth of the parasite and its hosts, and anatomy and functionality of haustoria. Target hosts were infected using C. pubescens already established on a donor host. This enabled measurement of growth in target hosts that were detached (parasite connection severed) or not from the donor host. Haustorial connections to hosts were investigated using histological methods. We tested the functionality of haustoria in one invasive and one native host using radiolabelled phosphorus (P-32). After it was severed from the donor host, C. pubescens grew poorly on the native host, Acacia myrtifolia (Sm.) Willd. This was likely due to a lack of effective functional haustorial development because although haustoria were firmly attached and morphologically alike those formed on the other hosts, their anatomy was different: their connections with the vascular system were not developed and there was no transfer of P-32 from A. myrtifolia to the parasite. In contrast, the other three host species supported the growth of the parasite and had fully developed haustoria. Effective transfer of P-32 from the invasive host to the parasite confirmed this. Our results suggest a range of defence mechanisms in C. pubescens hosts and are consistent with reports of strong detrimental effects on invasive hosts. Further, they amount to evidence for the potential use of a native parasite as biological control for invasive species.","[Facelli, Evelina; Wynn, Noriko; Tsang, Hong T.; Watling, Jennifer R.; Facelli, Jose M.] Univ Adelaide, Ecol & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Facelli, Evelina] Univ Adelaide, Agr Food & Wine, Waite Campus,PMB 1, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia; [Wynn, Noriko] Aurecon, 850 Collins St, Docklands, Vic 3008, Australia; [Tsang, Hong T.] City Univ Hong Kong, State Key Lab Marine Pollut, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Watling, Jennifer R.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, All St Bldg, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England",University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; City University of Hong Kong; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Facelli, E (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Ecol & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.;Facelli, E (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Agr Food & Wine, Waite Campus,PMB 1, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia.",evelina.facelli@adelaide.edu.au,"Watling, Jennifer R/B-9485-2008","Watling, Jennifer/0000-0001-6305-9905; Facelli, Evelina/0000-0002-6597-1890",,,,,44,4,4,1,12,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",0067-1924,1444-9862,,AUST J BOT,Aust.

This is reflected in the deterioration of the health status of stands due to the synergistic effect of numerous abiotic and biotic factors. Current forest health problems are due to dynamic, negative changes in the forest environment. While the amount of precipitation remains at a similar level, its distribution varies throughout the year and, in particular, the lack of soil moisture during the growing season leads to the weakening of trees, including the main forest-forming species in Poland such as Pinus sylvestris. The weakening of trees, in turn, leads to species of insect pests that were previously considered secondary becoming primary pests, such as Ips acuminatus. It is likely that weakening of trees also favours increased occurrence of parasitic plants such as Viscum album ssp. austriacum or Loranthus europaeus. Infestations of the hemiparasitic, xylem-secreting pine mistletoe are of great interest because they are spreading rapidly throughout Europe. Drought in forests is not only a long-term water shortage, but also a situation in which plant-fungal relationships are disrupted. Reduced water availability leads to a number of negative changes in the soil and the mycobiota that live there, affecting entire ecosystems. The effects of climate change and increased international trade are leading to the spread of pathogenic fungi and other harmful organisms whose range was previously restricted to the south of our continent. Unfavourable abiotic and biotic factors leading to weakening of oak stands in the western part of Poland have resulted in activation of new pests like Mediterranean oak borer. Intensification of transport and shortening of its duration, as well as climatic changes, favour the introduction of various organisms, including bark beetles (Scolytinae). In Poland, cyclic insect outbreaks are one of the most important problems in forest protection. Developing methods to monitor, prevent outbreaks and control the density of insect populations below harmful levels can be a challenge to consider. Finding an innovative system for applying insecticides to control spruce bark beetle could also be an interesting solution, where insects attracted to pheromones die after contact with the insecticide. Contact with the insecticide has a dual effect: either directly when the tree is treated, or when the bark beetle attempts to invade the tree. Opportunities for the use of biostimulants in forestry and is an attractive way to regenerate plants after negative stressors such as frost, drought or damage caused by improper use of pesticides, as well as the negative effects of diseases and pests. It acts indirectly by stimulating leaf, stem and root development and improving nutrient uptake. The effects of chemical treatments on fungal biodiversity in forests should be studied using powerful molecular tools such as NGS.","[Skrzecz, Iwona; Tkaczyk, Milosz; Oszako, Tomasz] Forest Res Inst, PL-05090 Sekocin Stary, Poland",Forest Research Institute,"Skrzecz, I; Oszako, T (corresponding author), Forest Res Inst, PL-05090 Sekocin Stary, Poland.",i.skrzecz@ibles.waw.pl; t.oszako@ibles.waw.pl,"Tkaczyk, Mi?osz/R-4949-2018; Oszako, Tomasz/P-3955-2016","Tkaczyk, Mi?osz/0000-0001-6031-996X; Oszako, Tomasz/0000-0003-4688-2582",,,,,0,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

There were 97 tree species, 76 shrubs, 70 vines, 181 terrestrial herbs? 39 epiphytes, 3 hemiparasites, 3 succulent rosette shrubs and 1 saprophyte. 3 Forest composition varied continuously with altitude, based on the Shipley & Keddy (1987) test, ordination via reciprocal averaging, and elevational trends in the Sorenson similarities of samples at adjacent altitudes. supporting the individualistic hypothesis of plant community organization. 4 Understorey herbs, shrubs and vines showed the greatest decline in species number with increasing altitude. This pattern is hypothesized to result from the more open, more frequently disturbed, and more completely deciduous canopies at lower, drier elevations. The proportion of evergreen woody plants was greater at higher altitudes, reflecting less seasonal aridity and greater soil leaching. The proportion of endozoochorous species increased with altitude, while the proportion of pterochorous and ectozoochorous species decreased, reflecting trends in the hypothesized efficacy of these mechanisms of seed dispersal. 5 Total basal area of woody plants > 2.5 cm d.b.h. and basal area per tree both increased roughly fourfold between 1500 and 2500 m. 6 Species richness decreased sharply with altitude, due mainly to decreases in terrestrial herbs, and (to a lesser extent) shrubs and vines. The average number of species per 0.1 ha declined from 134 at 1500m to 43 at 2500m. The numbers of species, genera and families per sample declined linearly with elevation. Species composition of samples within an altitudinal band showed greater horizontal turnover (beta diversity) at lower elevations, showing that low-elevation forests are not only locally more diverse, but spatially more patchy. Community composition varies roughly six times as rapidly with elevation as with the same distance horizontally. 7 A cascading series of effects of elevation on soil fertility, anti-herbivore defences, and the level of density-dependent mortality may account for the observed drop in diversity with elevation, and would be consistent with lower beta diversity and greater basal area at higher elevations.","Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Guadalajara, CUCBA, Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Universidad de Guadalajara,"Givnish, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, 430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",givnish@facstaff.wisc.edu,"Vázquez, Antonio/AAC-3461-2020; Vazquez-Garcia, J.

The mistletoe Struthanthus flexicaulis (Loranthaceae) is widely distributed in the campo rupestre ecosystem and likely has an important role in structuring the communities of which its hosts are part. The main goals of this study were to investigate the effects of parasitism by S. flexicaulis on host plants in a degraded area of campo rupestre and to determine how parasitism affects characteristics of the structure of this plant community over time. We found that parasitized plants had smaller crowns and branch growth, and suffered higher mortality compared to non-parasitized plants. Parasitism by S. flexicaulis decreased dominance and increased the diversity and evenness of plants in the community over time. Parasitism leads to competition with the host for water and nutrients, which may decrease the performance of the host and, consequently, leading to host death. The high mortality of the most abundant plant species led to a restructured woody plant community. These results reinforce the importance of parasitic plants that frequently play a key role in maintaining species diversity in plant communities.","[Monteiro, Graziella Franca; Novais, Samuel; Barbosa, Milton; Wilson Fernandes, G.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Ecol Evolut & Biodiversidade DGEE, BR-30270971 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Monteiro, Graziella Franca; Antonini, Yasmine; de Oliveira Passos, Marcela Fortes] Univ Fed Ouro Preto, Lab Biodiversidade, DEBIO, ICEB, BR-35400000 Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil; [de Oliveira Passos, Marcela Fortes] Univ Fed Lavras UFLA, DBI, Grad Program Appl Ecol, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto; Universidade Federal de Lavras,"Antonini, Y (corresponding author), Univ Fed Ouro Preto, Lab Biodiversidade, DEBIO, ICEB, BR-35400000 Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil.",antonini.y@gmail.com,"Barbosa, Milton/E-6737-2016; Fernandes, Geraldo/AAN-5602-2021","Barbosa, Milton/0000-0003-4243-7895; Fernandes, Geraldo/0000-0003-1559-6049; Antonini, Yasmine/0000-0002-5582-8193",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [PELD-CRSC-17 -441515/2016-9]; CAPES; CNPq,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"We thank two anonymous reviewers for their criticisms on earlier versions of the ms.

Some plant species are constrained to co-occur, for example parasitic plants and their hosts, and may overlap in their pollination niche if they flower at the same time and attract the same pollinators. Using field observations and experiments between 1996 and 2006, we tested a series of hypotheses regarding pollination niche overlap between a specialist parasitic plant Orobanche elatior (Orobanchaceae) and its host Centaurea scabiosa (Asteraceae). These species flower more or less at the same time, with some year-to-year variation. The host is pollinated by a diverse range of insects, which vary in their effectiveness, whilst the parasite is pollinated by a single species of bumblebee, Bombus pascuorum, which is also an effective pollinator of the host plant. The two species therefore have partially overlapping pollination niches. These niches are not finely subdivided by differential pollen placement, or by diurnal segregation of the niches. We therefore found no evidence of character displacement within the pollination niches of these species, possibly because pollinators are not a limiting resource for these plants. Direct observation of pollinator movements, coupled with experimental manipulations of host plant inflorescence density, showed that Bombus pascuorum only rarely moves between inflorescences of the host and the parasite and therefore the presence of one plant is unlikely to be facilitating pollination in the other. This is the first detailed examination of pollination niche overlap in a plant parasite system and we suggest avenues for future research in relation to pollination and other shared interactions between parasitic plants and their hosts.","Univ Northampton, Sch Appl Sci, Landscape & Biodivers Res Grp, Northampton NN2 7AL, England; Univ Aegean, Dept Geog, Mitilini 81100, Lesvos, Greece",University of Northampton; University of Aegean,"Ollerton, J (corresponding author), Univ Northampton, Sch Appl Sci, Landscape & Biodivers Res Grp, Pk Campus, Northampton NN2 7AL, England.",jeff.ollerton@northampton.ac.uk,"Ollerton, Jeff/AAE-3946-2020; Ollerton, Jeff/I-3946-2012","Ollerton, Jeff/0000-0002-0887-8235; Ollerton, Jeff/0000-0002-0887-8235",,,,,94,37,40,1,62,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2007,151,3,,,,,473,485,,10.1007/s00442-006-0605-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0605-y,,,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,143AP,17146683,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000244692700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

A wide range of morphological characters was examined on specimens collected for this study. The corolla size, the corolla colour and the anther length are considered the most important morphological characters at the interspecific taxonomic level. The morphological and molecular variation of the Melampyrum sylvaticum group in the Sudeten, Alps and Carpathians was analyzed. The morphometric study of European populations of Melampyrum sylvaticum group partly clarified the pattern of the variation of selected characters in this region. The RAPD analysis manifests a very similar trend of the population grouping. The combined analysis of morphological and molecular data gives the most explicit results. Central European yellow flowering populations of M. sylvaticum group form two distinctive groups. The first one is an exclusive type of the Alps and of the Hercynian Mountains (except the Sudeten). The second group has its centre of distribution in the eastern part of the Carpathians. This type was described as Melampyrum herbichii from the present Ukrainian Carpathians and was regarded to be endemic to the Eastern and Southern Carpathians. Populations from the Western Carpathians and Sudeten Mts. are polymorphic. They seem to be closer to M herbichii based on the RAPD markers, whereas the morphology of most populations from these regions is closer to M. sylvaticum s.str. The bract shape seems to be important for discrimination between both groups of populations along with the flower characters and a modest ecological differentiation. The Eastern Carpathian Melampyrum saxosum with white corolla is very close to M herbichii based on the studied morphological characters.","Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci, Branisovska 31, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CS-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Stech, M (corresponding author), Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci, Branisovska 31, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",stech@bf.jeu.cz; drabkova@ibot.cas.cz,"Drabkova, Lenka Zaveska/F-6999-2012; Stech, Milan/C-9805-2009","Drabkova, Lenka Zaveska/0000-0003-1140-6607; Stech, Milan/0000-0002-2987-6052",,,,,26,6,7,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1211-9520,1874-9348,,FOLIA GEOBOT,Folia Geobot.,,2005,40,2-3,,,,,177,193,,10.1007/BF02803233,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02803233,,,17,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Plant Sciences,945YZ,,,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000230540200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

We asked (1) whether there is a threshold limit for total annual aboveground biomass production of vascular plants above which R. minor cannot establish viable population in grasslands and (2) how is cover of R. minor in grassland related to standing biomass of bryophytes. Data were collected in the Rengen Grassland Experiment (RGE) established in Germany in 1941 with following fertilizer treatments: unfertilized control, application of Ca, CaN, CaNP, CaNPKCl and CaNPK2SO4. Cover of R. minor and total annual aboveground biomass production of vascular plants were determined from 2005 to 2009. Further relationship between standing biomass of bryophytes and cover of R. minor was analyzed in 2006. Mean cover of R. minor over five years ranged from 0.7% to 12.3% in CaNPK2SO4 and control treatments, respectively. Cover of R. minor was significantly negatively related to total annual aboveground biomass production of vascular plants and cover of R. minor was below 3% in all plots with total annual aboveground dry matter biomass production of vascular plants higher than 5 t/ha. Although cover of R. minor was markedly reduced in highly productive plots in the RGE, high standing biomass of bryophytes (1.8 t/ha) in low productive control was not an obstacle for establishment of its viable population. We concluded, that viable population of R. minor can be established in grasslands only if total annual aboveground dry matter biomass production of vascular plants is below 5 t/ha regardless on standing biomass of bryophytes.","[Schellberg, J.] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, Katzenburgweg 5, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Hejcman, M.; Pavlu, V.] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hejcman, M.; Pavlu, V.] Crop Res Inst, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Bonn; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech Crop Research Institute (CRI),"Schellberg, J (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, Katzenburgweg 5, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",j.schellberg@uni-bonn.de,,"Hejcman, Michal/0000-0002-3513-2017",Czech Science Foundation [521/08/1131]; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic [MZE 0002700604],"Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Agriculture, Czech Republic)","Supported by the Czech Science Foundation, Project No. 521/08/1131 and by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic, Project No. MZE 0002700604.",,39,21,21,0,29,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",1214-1178,1805-9368,,PLANT SOIL ENVIRON,Plant Soil Environ.,,2011,57,2,,,,,45,51,,10.17221/197/2010-PSE,http://dx.doi.org/10.17221/197/2010-PSE,,,7,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,741MZ,,gold,,,2023-05-23,WOS:000288869100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, related mechanisms and the effect of environments on the control effect of the parasite are still unclear. In addition, few related studies have been conducted in high latitude (>40 degrees), where the exotic plant richness is the highest in the globe, but natural enemies are relatively scarce. During field surveys, a Cuscuta species was found on the cosmopolitan invasive weed Ambrosia trifida L. in Shenyang, northeast China. Here, we first studied the impacts of the parasite on the invader at three sites with different light regimes and related mechanisms, then the haustorial connections between the parasite and the invader using anatomy and measurement of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotope compositions (delta C-13, delta N-15), and finally identified the parasite using two molecular marks. The parasite was identified as C. japonica Choisy. This native holoparasitic vine posed serious C rather than N limitation to the invader, explaining its greatly inhibitory effects on the invader. Its negative effects were stronger on reproductive relative to vegetative growth, and at high relative to low light habitats, which indicated that the higher the vigor of the host is, the higher the impact of the parasite pose. The parasite could establish haustorial connections with phloem, xylem, and pith of the invader and thus obtain resources from both leaves and roots, which was confirmed by difference of delta C-13 and delta N-15 between the two species. The parasite had significantly higher leaf C concentrations and delta C-13 than its invasive host, being a strong C sink of the parasitic association. Our results indicate that C. japonica may be a promising biological control agent for the noxious invader in China.","[Wang, Wei-Bin; Gao, Fan-Fan; Wu, Qi-Ye] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wei-Bin; Feng, Wei-Wei; Feng, Yu-Long] Shenyang Agr Univ, Liaoning Key Lab Biol Invas & Global Changes, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Feng, Wei-Wei; Feng, Yu-Long] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Biosci & Biotechnol, Shenyang, Peoples R China",Shenyang Agricultural University; Shenyang Agricultural University; Shenyang Agricultural University,"Feng, YL (corresponding author), Shenyang Agr Univ, Liaoning Key Lab Biol Invas & Global Changes, Shenyang, Peoples R China.;Feng, YL (corresponding author), Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Biosci & Biotechnol, Shenyang, Peoples R China.",fyl@syau.edu.cn,"Feng, Yulong/B-7416-2012",,National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Key Research and Development Program of China;  [32171667];  [31971557];  [32171666];  [2017YFC-1200101],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; ; ; ; ,"Funding This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32171667, 31971557 and 32171666) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC-1200101).",,58,0,0,6,9,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

In about 50% of the epiphytic orchids from evergreen higher and lower montane forests the delta(13)C values were indicative for CAM. The remainder of the species are presumably C-3 plants. In all samples of malagasy epiphytic leafless orchids comprising 9 species, the delta(13)C values suggest extreme CAM with CO2 uptake proceeding entirely during the night. All terrestrial orchids collected in the lower montane forests obviously acquire external carbon by C-3-photosynthesis, whereas Lissochilus decaryi, a terrestrial orchid from the semi-arid south of Madagascar and various other species of this genus are CAM plants. This is the first report of CAM occurrence in sympodial terrestrial orchids. Judged by the delta(13)C values, all succulents (mainly Didiereaceae, Euphorbiaceae. Crassulaceae and Asclepiadaceae) collected at the xerophytic thorn-bush of the semi-arid south perform pronounced CAM. Where it applies, our delta(13)C measurements in the thorn-bush succulents revealed values being practically identical with those found by K. Winter in samples of the same species collected at the same site nearly 10 years earlier. This shows extreme constancy over long duration of time in the mode of CAM performed by the succulents of the malagasy thorn-bush vegetation. Since the delta(13)C survey now comprises all 11 known species of the Didiereaceae, it is unequivocally clear that all members of this family are CAM plants. Most of the individuals of the species of the Didiereaceae grown in a glass-house had slightly more negative delta(13)C values compared with those grown at the natural stands suggesting some contribution of C-3-photosynthesis to carbon acquisition under the evaporatively less demanding lass-house conditions (and perhaps higher CO2 concentrations in the gas phase). Despite of the fact that the hydrogen isotope composition of meteoric waters depends to a large extent on the altitude and temperature-climate of the site where the concerned plants grow, it was found that in samples obtained in the cooler higher evergreen montane forest as well as in the warmer lower evergreen montane forest and the lowland thorn-bush of the hot, semiarid south of Madagascar the delta values found in the organic matter (delta D-org) were in the same range (between about - 10 parts per thousand, to about - 90 parts per thousand,). This suggests that in our case the hydrogen isotope compositions of the meteoric waters were of minor importance in bringing about the delta D-org values found in the plants. The correlation between the delta(13)C and the delta D-org values of the plants proposed in the literature was found only in the case of epiphytic orchids from the higher evergreen montane forests. In the orchids from the lower montane forests and in the succulents of the thorn-bush, no clear-cut correlation of the two isotopic parameters could be detected. In both the orchids of the montane forests and the kalanchoe species, the delta(13)C values clearly became less negative with increase of leaf thickness showing the expected correlation of CAM with the degree of succulence. In the orchids, but not in the kalanchoe species, the delta D values also tended to become less negative with increase of leaf thickness suggesting that enrichment of the leaf material with deuterium might be related to succulence, i.e. to the water storage capacity of the leaves. In mistletoe-host couples studied at the lower montane forest and in thorn-bush, the delta(13)C values of the hemiparasite were more negative compared with the host, whereas in two of three investigated cases the delta D values tended to be less negative in the mistletoes indicating that enrichment in deuterium took place in them.","UNIV PARIS 11, INST BIOTECHNOL PLANETS, ORSAY, FRANCE; UNIV ANTANANARIVO, EES SCI, LAB PHYSIOL VEGETALE, ANTANANARIO, MADAGASCAR; TECH UNIV MUNICH, INST BOT, W-8000 MUNICH, GERMANY",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; University Antananarivo; Technical University of Munich,"Kluge, M (corresponding author), TH DARMSTADT, INST BOT, SCHNITTSPAHNSTR 10, D-64287 DARMSTADT, GERMANY.",,,,,,,,41,18,20,0,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1025-6016,1477-2639,,ISOT ENVIRON HEALT S,Isot.
